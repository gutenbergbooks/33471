<h3 style="margin-top: 5em;">Preface</h3>

<p>Very few of the <i>Fornaldar Sögur Northrlanda</i>
have hitherto been translated into English. The
<i>Völsungasaga</i> is of course well known, but with this
exception the 'Stories of Icelanders,' and the 'Stories
of the Kings of Norway' are probably the only sagas
familiar to the majority of English readers. Of
the four sagas contained in this volume only one&mdash;the
<i>Tháttr of Sörli</i>&mdash;has appeared in English before,
though the poetry which they contain has frequently
been translated, from the time of Hickes's <i>Thesaurus</i>
(1705). So far as I am aware no version of any of the
Faroese ballads has appeared in English. Out of the
great number which were collected during the 18th
and 19th centuries I have chosen a few which deal
with the same stories as the sagas translated here;
and for purposes of comparison I have added a short
extract from one of the Icelandic <i>Rímur</i>, as well as a
Danish ballad and part of the Shetland <i>Hildina</i>.</p>

<p>In accordance with general custom in works of
this kind I have discarded the use of accents, unfamiliar
symbols, etc., except in a few Norse words
which can hardly be anglicised.</p>

<p>My thanks are due to the Syndics of the Cambridge
University Press for undertaking the publication
of this book, and to the staff for their unfailing
courtesy.</p>

<p>To Professor Thuren of Christiania I am indebted
for kindly allowing me to print the melodies from
his son's <i>Folkesangen paa Færøerne</i>. I have also to
thank many friends in St Andrews and Cambridge
for help which they have kindly given to me in
various ways, including Professor Lawson, Dr Maitland
Anderson and the staffs of the two University
Libraries, and Mr B. Dickins. Especially I wish to
thank Professor Chadwick to whom I am indebted
for constant help and advice throughout the book.</p>

<h3>SAGAS</h3>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page3" id="page3"></a>[pg 3]</span>

<h3 style="margin-top: 3em;">THE SAGAS</h3>

<h4>GENERAL INTRODUCTION</h4>

<p>The following stories are taken from the <i>Fornaldarsögur
Northrlanda</i>, or 'Stories of Ancient Times
relating to the countries of the North'&mdash;a collection
of Sagas edited by Rafn in 1829-30 and re-edited by
Valdimar Ásmundarson in 1886-1891. The stories
contained in this collection deal almost exclusively
with times anterior to Harold the Fairhaired
(c. 860-930) and the colonisation of Iceland, and
stop therefore where the better known stories
relating to Iceland and the historical kings of
Norway begin. Some of them relate to persons and
events of the ninth century, while others are concerned
with times as remote as the fourth or fifth
centuries. Their historical value is naturally far
inferior to that of the <i>Íslendinga Sögur</i>, or 'Stories
of Icelanders' and the <i>Konunga Sögur</i>, or 'Stories
of the Kings.'</p>

<p>From the literary point of view also the 'Stories
of Ancient Times' are generally much inferior to
the others. The 'Stories of Icelanders' are derived
from oral tradition, which generally goes back in
more or less fixed form to the time at which the
characters in the stories lived, and they give us a
vivid picture of the persons themselves and of the
conditions of life in their time. In the 'Stories of
Ancient Times,' on the other hand, though there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page4" id="page4"></a>[pg 4]</span>
is some element derived from tradition, often
apparently of a local character, it is generally very
meagre. More often perhaps the source of the
stories is to be found in poems, notable instances of
which will be found in <i>Hervarar Saga</i> and in
<i>Völsunga Saga</i>. In many cases, however, the stories
without doubt contain a large proportion of purely
fictitious matter.</p>

<p>The texts of the 'Stories of Ancient Times'
which have come down to us date as a rule from the
thirteenth and the beginning of the fourteenth
centuries though the actual <span class="sc">mss</span>. themselves are
generally later. Most of the stories, however, were
probably in existence before this time. The Danish
historian Saxo Grammaticus (c. 1200) was familiar
with many of them, including the story of Hethin
and Högni<a id="footnotetagi1" name="footnotetagi1"></a><a href="#footnotei1"><sup>1</sup></a> and one of the scenes recorded in
<i>Hervarar Saga</i><a id="footnotetagi2" name="footnotetagi2"></a><a href="#footnotei2"><sup>2</sup></a>. And we are told that a story which
seems to have corresponded, in its main outlines at
least, to the story of Hromund Greipsson was composed
and recited at a wedding in Iceland in 1119<a id="footnotetagi3" name="footnotetagi3"></a><a href="#footnotei3"><sup>3</sup></a>.
But in many cases the materials of our stories were
far earlier than this, though they no doubt underwent
considerable changes before they assumed their
present form.</p>

<p>Indeed many stages in the literary history of the
North are represented in the following translations.
Of these probably the oldest is that section of the
<i>Hervarar Saga</i> which deals with the battle between
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page5" id="page5"></a>[pg 5]</span>
the Goths and the Huns "at Dylgia and on Dunheith
and upon all the heights of Jösur." The poetry
here included in the saga dates even in its present
form probably from the Viking Age, perhaps from
the tenth century. But the verses themselves do not
appear to be all of the same date. Some of them show
a certain elaboration and a sense of conscious art,
while others are comparatively bare and primitive
in type and contain very early features<a id="footnotetagi4" name="footnotetagi4"></a><a href="#footnotei4"><sup>4</sup></a>; and there
is every probability that such poetry was ultimately
derived from poetry composed at a time when the
Goths were still remembered. This is not surprising
in view of the fact that stories relating to the Goths
were popular in English and German heroic poetry,
as well as in the heroic lays of the North. Indeed we
know from Jordanes<a id="footnotetagi5" name="footnotetagi5"></a><a href="#footnotei5"><sup>5</sup></a> and elsewhere that heroic poetry
was common among the Goths themselves and that
they were wont to celebrate the deeds of their
ancestors in verse sung to the accompaniment of
the harp.</p>

<p>This poem is no doubt much older than the saga.
Originally it would seem to have been complete in
itself; but many verses have probably been lost.
Thus there can be little doubt that the prose passages
in chs. XII-XV are often merely a paraphrase of lost
verses, though it must not be assumed that all the
prose in this portion of the saga originated in such
a way<a id="footnotetagi6" name="footnotetagi6"></a><a href="#footnotei6"><sup>6</sup></a>. "It is difficult to tell ... where the prose of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page6" id="page6"></a>[pg 6]</span>
the manuscripts is to be taken as standing in the
place of lost narrative verses, and where it fills a
gap that was never intended to be filled with verse,
but was always left to the reciter to be supplied in
his own way<a id="footnotetagi7" name="footnotetagi7"></a><a href="#footnotei7"><sup>7</sup></a>." The difficulty, however, is greater
in some cases than in others. The following picturesque
passage from the opening of ch. 14 of the
<i>Hervarar Saga</i> is a very probable instance of a
paraphrase of lost verses:</p>

<blockquote><p>
It happened one morning at sunrise that as Hervör was
standing on the summit of a tower over the gate of the
fortress, she looked southwards towards the forest and saw
clouds of dust, arising from a great body of horse, by which
the sun was hidden for a long time. Next she saw a gleam
beneath the dust, as though she were gazing on a mass of
gold&mdash;fair shields overlaid with gold, gilded helmets and
white corslets.
</p></blockquote>

<p>The motif of a chief or his lady standing on the
pinnacle of a tower of the fort and looking out
over the surrounding country for an approaching
army is a very common one in ballads. The motif of
the above passage from <i>Hervarar Saga</i>, including the
armour of the foe and the shining shields, occurs in
the opening stanzas of the Danish Ballad <i>De vare
syv og syvsindstyve</i><a id="footnotetagi8" name="footnotetagi8"></a><a href="#footnotei8"><sup>8</sup></a>, which probably dates from the
fourteenth century (though it may possibly be later<a id="footnotetagi9" name="footnotetagi9"></a><a href="#footnotei9"><sup>9</sup></a>)
and which derives its material ultimately from old
heroic lays<a id="footnotetagi10" name="footnotetagi10"></a><a href="#footnotei10"><sup>10</sup></a>.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page7" id="page7"></a>[pg 7]</span>

<p>To the same period approximately as the poem on
the battle with the Huns belong the two pieces from
the <i>Older Edda</i> contained in the <i>Tháttr</i><a id="footnotetagi11" name="footnotetagi11"></a><a href="#footnotei11"><sup>11</sup></a> <i>of Nornagest</i>.
The <i>Reginsmál</i> indeed, of which only about
half is quoted, may be even earlier than the former
(in the form in which it appears in <i>Hervarar Saga</i>),
while the <i>Hellride of Brynhild</i> can hardly be later
than the early part of the eleventh century.</p>

<p>A second stage in the literary history of the North
is represented by the 'episodic' poems <i>Hjalmar's
Death Song</i> and the <i>Waking of Angantyr</i>, both of
which are attributed to the twelfth century by
Heusler and Ranisch<a id="footnotetagi12" name="footnotetagi12"></a><a href="#footnotei12"><sup>12</sup></a>. Unlike the poem on the
battle between the Goths and the Huns, neither of
these forms a story complete in itself. They presuppose
the existence of a saga in some form or
other, presumably oral, dealing at least with the
fight at Samsø; and the existence of such a saga in
the twelfth century is confirmed by the account of
the same event given by Saxo<a id="footnotetagi13" name="footnotetagi13"></a><a href="#footnotei13"><sup>13</sup></a>.</p>

<p>A third stage in the literary development of the
heroic legends is represented by the written saga
itself, which has evidently been formed by the
welding together, with more or less skill as the case
may be, of several distinct stories, and of more than
one literary form. A particularly striking instance of
this is to be found in the <i>Hervarar Saga</i> with its
stories of the Heroic and Viking Ages, the poems
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page8" id="page8"></a>[pg 8]</span>
dealing with the fight on Samsø, the primitive
Riddles of Gestumblindi and the early poem of the
battle between the Goths and Huns<a id="footnotetagi14" name="footnotetagi14"></a><a href="#footnotei14"><sup>14</sup></a>. Something of
the same kind has also taken place in the composition
of the <i>Thættir of Nornagest</i> and of <i>Sörli</i> respectively,
though into the former has entered a considerable
element of folk-tale which is introduced with a
certain <i>naïveté</i> and no little skill alongside the old
heroic legends. As has been already mentioned,
these three sagas, like others of the same type,
appear to have been written down in the late thirteenth
or the early years of the fourteenth century.
On the other hand most if not the whole of the
<i>Saga of Hromund Greipsson</i> appears to have been
composed early in the twelfth century, but we do
not know when it was first written down.</p>

<p>A fourth stage is represented by the Icelandic
<i>Rímur</i> which are for the most part rhyming metrical
versions of the sagas and which date from the fourteenth
and fifteenth centuries. As an illustration of
this stage I have translated a few stanzas from the
<i>Gríplur</i>, a <i>Ríma</i> based on an early form of the
story of Hromund Greipsson<a id="footnotetagi15" name="footnotetagi15"></a><a href="#footnotei15"><sup>15</sup></a>. The <i>Rímur</i> are,
so far as we can judge, somewhat wearisome paraphrases
of the prose stories, and while the metre and
diction are elaborate in the extreme, the treatment of
the story is often mechanical and puerile. Comparatively
few of the <i>Rímur</i> have as yet been published
and the <i>Gríplur</i> is the only one known to me which
is primarily concerned with any of the sagas contained
in this volume.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page9" id="page9"></a>[pg 9]</span>

<p>The ballads, both Faroese and Danish<a id="footnotetagi16" name="footnotetagi16"></a><a href="#footnotei16"><sup>16</sup></a>, belong to
a fifth stage in the life of heroic legend in the North;
but their origin and history is by no means so clear
as that of the <i>Rímur</i>, and it is at present impossible
to assign even approximate dates to more than a
few of them with any degree of certainty. I have
touched on this question at somewhat greater length
below<a id="footnotetagi17" name="footnotetagi17"></a><a href="#footnotei17"><sup>17</sup></a>; and I would only add here that some Danish
and Swedish ballads, e.g. <i>Ung Sveidal</i><a id="footnotetagi18" name="footnotetagi18"></a><a href="#footnotei18"><sup>18</sup></a>, <i>Thord af
Haffsgaard</i><a id="footnotetagi19" name="footnotetagi19"></a><a href="#footnotei19"><sup>19</sup></a>
and perhaps <i>Her Aage</i><a id="footnotetagi20" name="footnotetagi20"></a><a href="#footnotei20"><sup>20</sup></a>, appear to be
derived more or less directly from poems of the
Viking Age, such as <i>Fjölsvinsmál</i>, <i>Thrymskvitha</i> and
<i>Helgakvitha Hundingsbana I</i>&mdash;without any intermediate
prose stage.</p>

<p>A careful study of the Faroese ballads as a whole
might enable one to determine something more of
the relation of ballads to 'Literature'<a id="footnotetagi21" name="footnotetagi21"></a><a href="#footnotei21"><sup>21</sup></a> and of the
various ballad forms to one another, such as that of
the short and simple <i>Ballad of Hjalmar and Angantyr</i>
to the longer and more complicated <i>Ballad of Arngrims
Sons</i>. Simplification and confusion are among
the chief characteristics of popular poetry<a id="footnotetagi22" name="footnotetagi22"></a><a href="#footnotei22"><sup>22</sup></a>; but it is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page10" id="page10"></a>[pg 10]</span>
to be noted that in the case of the <i>Hervarar Saga</i>
confusion set in long before the days of the ballad&mdash;as
early as the saga itself, where there must surely be
at least one case of repetition of character<a id="footnotetagi23" name="footnotetagi23"></a><a href="#footnotei23"><sup>23</sup></a>. In reality,
considering through how many stages the ballad
material has passed, one is amazed at the vitality of
the stories and the amount of original groundwork
preserved. A careful comparison of the <i>Völsunga Saga</i>
and the Faroese cycle of ballads generally classed
together as <i>Sjúrðar Kvæði</i>&mdash;which, be it observed,
were never written down at all till the nineteenth
century&mdash;brings out to a degree literally amazing the
conservatism of the ballads on the old heroic themes.</p>

<p>Readers who desire to make further acquaintance
with the 'Stories of Ancient Times' as a whole will
find a further account of the subject in Professor
Craigie's <i>Icelandic Sagas</i> (p. 92 ff.). More detailed
accounts will be found in Finnur Jónsson's <i>Oldnorske
og Oldislandske Litteraturs Historie</i><a id="footnotetagi24" name="footnotetagi24"></a><a href="#footnotei24"><sup>24</sup></a>, Vol. <span class="sc">ii</span>,

Literatur</i> in Paul's <i>Grundriss der Germanischen
Philologie</i>, Ed. <span class="sc">ii</span>, 1904, Vol. II, pp. 830-857,
while a discussion of the heroic stories will be

<h3 style="margin-top: 3em;">INTRODUCTION TO THE THÁTTR OF NORNAGEST</h3>

<p>This story occurs as an episode in the long <i>Saga
of Olaf Tryggvason</i>&mdash;to be distinguished from the
shorter <i>Saga of Olaf Tryggvason</i> contained in the
<i>Heimskringla</i> and translated by Morris and Magnússon
in the <i>Saga Library</i><a id="footnotetag1" name="footnotetag1"></a><a href="#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a>.
The best known manuscript (<i>F</i>) of the longer saga is the <i>Flateyjarbók</i> which
comes from the island of Flatey in Breithifjörth off
the west of Iceland, and was written between 1386
and 1394. The second (<i>S</i>) is the Codex <i>Arn. Magn.
62</i> in the Royal Library (at Copenhagen), which, like
the former, contains a fragment only of the <i>Saga of
Olaf Tryggvason</i>, but includes the <i>Tháttr of Nornagest</i>.
This <span class="sc">ms</span>. dates, in all probability, from shortly after
the middle of the fourteenth century. Finally, besides
several paper <span class="sc">mss</span>. (comparatively late and unimportant),
there is a <span class="sc">ms</span>. <i>A</i> (number 2845 of the
Royal Library at Copenhagen) dating from the
fifteenth century, in which the <i>tháttr</i> stands by itself.</p>

<p>Rafn<a id="footnotetag2" name="footnotetag2"></a><a href="#footnote2"><sup>2</sup></a>, in his edition of the <i>Fornaldarsögur</i>, based
his text of the <i>tháttr</i> on <i>A</i>; but subsequent examination
has rendered it probable that this <span class="sc">ms</span>. is hardly
independent of <i>F</i> which gives an earlier and better
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page12" id="page12"></a>[pg 12]</span>
text. As regards <span class="sc">mss</span>. <i>F</i> and <i>S</i>, the latter frequently
gives a better reading than the former<a id="footnotetag3" name="footnotetag3"></a><a href="#footnote3"><sup>3</sup></a>. For this
reason it was followed by Bugge<a id="footnotetag4" name="footnotetag4"></a><a href="#footnote4"><sup>4</sup></a> who believed it to
be the better source. Wilken<a id="footnotetag5" name="footnotetag5"></a><a href="#footnote5"><sup>5</sup></a> however held that
<i>F</i> represents the 'Vulgate' of the <i>tháttr</i>, while <i>S</i>
gives a corrected and edited version. In his edition,
therefore, he chiefly followed <i>F</i>, though he made use
of <i>S</i> throughout, and also (for the poems) the
<i>Codex Regius</i> of the Older Edda. His example has
been followed by later editors, including Valdimar
Ásmundarson<a id="footnotetag6" name="footnotetag6"></a><a href="#footnote6"><sup>6</sup></a>, from whose version the following
translation has been made. The differences between
all three <span class="sc">mss</span>. appear to be very slight, but Ásmundarson's
edition approximates more closely to
Wilken's than to Rafn's. Indeed the variations
between the texts of Wilken's second edition<a id="footnotetag7" name="footnotetag7"></a><a href="#footnote7"><sup>7</sup></a> and
Ásmundarson are negligible. For a full bibliography
of texts, translations, and literature relating to this
saga the reader is referred to <i>Islandica</i>, Vol. <span class="sc">v</span>,
p. 32.</p>

<p>The saga itself dates from about 1300<a id="footnotetag8" name="footnotetag8"></a><a href="#footnote8"><sup>8</sup></a>. It is
derived from tradition, mainly Icelandic; but the
various stories contained in it differ greatly from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page13" id="page13"></a>[pg 13]</span>
one another in their historical value. This episode
is probably to be regarded as legendary in part;
and it would seem also to contain a good deal of
conscious fiction.</p>

<p>The <i>tháttr</i> falls naturally into three parts. The
framework of the story&mdash;the arrival of Guest at the
hall of Olaf Tryggvason, his inclusion in the King's
retinue, and his baptism&mdash;forms a whole in itself
and contains nothing inherently improbable save
the manner of his death, where the folk-tale element
creeps in. The first 'story within a story,' the
account that Guest gives of his wanderings and more
especially of the adventures of Sigurth, is legendary&mdash;or
perhaps rather made up from old legends with
the help of the <i>Edda</i> poems. As in the case of the
Anglo-Saxon poem <i>Widsith</i>&mdash;and indeed to a much
greater extent&mdash;the persons who figure in the
stranger's stories lived in reality in widely different
ages. Sigurth and his brothers-in-law belong to the
early part of the fifth century, Harold the Fairhaired
and the sons of Lothbrok to the latter part of the
ninth century. Other characters such as Guthmund
of Glasisvellir who is mentioned in the first chapters
are probably mythical.</p>

<p>The third part, which is perhaps the most interesting
part of the <i>tháttr</i>, is the passage in which
Guest explains how he came by his name. There
can be no doubt that here we are in the region of
pure folk-tale. The story of the visit of the Norns
shows a very remarkable resemblance to the Greek
legend of Althaea and Meleager. The same motif
appears to some extent in the mediaeval French
romances of <i>Ogier the Dane</i>, and is familiar to everyone
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page14" id="page14"></a>[pg 14]</span>
in a slightly different form as the first part of
the German folk-tale, <i>Sleeping Beauty</i>, where the
reference to spinning should be noted.</p>

<p>The poetry contained in this <i>tháttr</i>, unlike that in
the <i>Hervarar Saga</i>, is all taken from the <i>Older Edda</i>.
One of the poems, the <i>Hellride of Brynhild</i>, is given
almost complete and there are long extracts from
<i>Reginsmál</i>. There are, however, some references to
poems which no longer exist<a id="footnotetag9" name="footnotetag9"></a><a href="#footnote9"><sup>9</sup></a>.</p>

<p>In many respects the story of Nornagest is among
the most interesting of the Romantic Sagas. It gives
a vivid picture of life in a northern court&mdash;the
<i>naïveté</i> and friendliness of the conversation; the
personal interest that the King took in his men; the
intimacy and directness and simplicity of the intercourse
between them. There is something, too, of the
same boyish indulgence&mdash;e.g. in King Olaf's attitude
towards the wager&mdash;which one notices in Hrolf
Kraki's talk with Vögg<a id="footnotetag10" name="footnotetag10"></a><a href="#footnote10"><sup>10</sup></a>. Yet combined with the
amiability of both kings is a certain natural dignity
which is very convincing.</p>

<h3 style="margin-top: 3em;">THE THÁTTR OF NORNAGEST<a href="#nn">°</a></h3>
<a name="n1" id="n1"></a>
<p class="indent">I.<a href="#nn1">°</a> &nbsp;The story goes that on one occasion when
King Olaf Tryggvason was living at Trondhjem, it
chanced that a man came to him late in the day and
addressed him respectfully. The King welcomed him
and asked him who he was, and he said that his name
was Guest.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page15" id="page15"></a>[pg 15]</span>

<p>The King answered: "You shall be guest here,
whatever you are called."</p>

<p>Guest said: "I have told you my name truly, Sire,
and I will gladly receive your hospitality if I may."</p>

<p>The King told him he could have it readily. But
since the day was far spent, the King would not enter
into conversation with his guest; for he was going
soon to vespers, and after that to dinner, and then to
bed and to sleep.</p>

<p>Now on that same night King Olaf Tryggvason
was lying awake in his bed and saying his prayers,
while all the other men in the hall were asleep. Then
the King noticed that an elf or spirit of some kind
had come into the hall, though all the doors were
locked. He made his way past the beds of the men
who were asleep there, one after another, and at last
reached the bed of a man at the far end.</p>

<p>Then the elf stopped and said: "An empty house,
and a mighty strong bolt on the door! People
say that the King is the wisest of men. If he were
as clever in things of this kind as they say he would
not sleep so soundly."</p>

<p>After that he vanished through the door, locked
as it was.</p>

<p>Early next morning the King sent his servant to
find out who had occupied that bed over night, and
it proved to have been the stranger. The King ordered
him to be summoned before him and asked
him whose son he was.</p>

<p>He answered: "My father's name was Thorth.
He was a Dane and was called 'The Contentious,'
and lived at a place called Groening in Denmark."</p>

<p>"You are a well set-up man," said the King.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page16" id="page16"></a>[pg 16]</span>

<p>Guest was bold of speech, and bigger in build
than most men. He looked strong but was somewhat
advanced in years. He asked the King if he
might stay for a while in his retinue. The King
asked if he were baptised. Guest said that he
had been prime-signed but not baptised. The King
said that he was free to remain in his retinue, but
added:</p>

<p>"You will not remain long unbaptised with me."</p>

<p>The reason for the elf's remark about the bolt was
that Guest had crossed himself, that evening like
other men, but was in reality still a heathen.</p>

<p>The King said: "Can you do anything in the way
of sport or music?"</p>

<p>He replied that he could play the harp and tell
stories which people enjoyed.</p>

<p>Then said the King: "King Svein has no right to
let unbaptised men leave his kingdom and wander
about from one country to another."</p>

<p>Guest replied: "You must not blame the King of
the Danes for this, for it is a long time since I left
Denmark. In fact it was a long time before the
Emperor Otto burnt the Dane-work and forced
King Harold Gormsson and Earl Haakon the Heathen
to become Christians."</p>

<p>The King questioned Guest about many subjects
and he always gave him good and intelligent answers.
Men say that it was in the third year of King Olaf's
reign that Guest came to him.</p>

<p>In this year also there came to him two men called
Grim who were sent by Guthmund from Glasisvellir.
They brought to the King as a present from Guthmund
two horns which were also called 'Grim.'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page17" id="page17"></a>[pg 17]</span>
They had also some further business with the King
which we will return later.</p>

<p>As for Guest, he remained with the King, and had
a place at the far end of the visitors' seats. He was
a man of breeding and had good manners, and was
popular and much respected by everyone.</p>

<a name="n2" id="n2"></a>
<p class="indent">II.<a href="#nn2">°</a> &nbsp;A little before Yule, Ulf the Red and his
following came home. He had been engaged on the
King's business all summer, for he had been appointed
to guard the coasts of 'The Bay' against
Danish raids. He never failed to be with King Olaf
at mid-winter.</p>

<p>Ulf had many fine treasures to bring to the King,
which he had got during the summer, and one gold
ring in particular which was called Hnituth. It was
welded together in seven places and each piece had a
different colour. It was made of much finer gold than
rings usually are. The ring had been given to Ulf by a
landowner called Lothmund, and before that it had
belonged to King Half, from whom the Halfsrekkar
take their name. The ring had come to them as
forced tribute from King Halfdan Ylfing. Lothmund
had asked Ulf in return for it that he would
guard his home with the support of King Olaf, and
Ulf had promised to do so.</p>

<p>Now King Olaf was keeping Yule in magnificent
style at his court in Trondhjem; and it was on the
eighth day of Yule that Ulf gave him the gold ring
Hnituth. The King thanked him for the gift as well
as for all the faithful service which he had constantly
rendered him.</p>

<p>The ring was passed round the building in which
the drinking was going on.&mdash;As yet no halls had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page18" id="page18"></a>[pg 18]</span>
been built in Norway. Now each man showed it to
his neighbour and they thought that they had never
seen such fine gold as that of which the ring was
made. At last it came to the guest-table, and so to the
guest who had just arrived. He looked at the ring
and handed it back on the palm of his hand&mdash;the
hand in which he had been holding his drinking
horn. He was not much impressed with the treasure,
and made no remarks about it, but went on jesting
with his companions. A serving-man was pouring
out drink at the end of the guest-table.</p>

<p>"Do you not like the ring?" he asked.</p>

<p>They said; "We all like it very much except the
new-comer. He can't see anything in it; but we
think he can't appreciate it simply because he
doesn't care for things of this kind."</p>

<p>The serving-man went up the hall to the King and
told him exactly what the guests had said, adding that,
the new-comer had taken little note of the treasure,
valuable as it was, when it was shown to him.</p>

<p>Then the King remarked: "The new-comer
probably knows more than you think: he must come
to me in the morning and tell me a story."</p>

<p>Now he and the other guests at the farthest table
were talking among themselves. They asked the
new-comer where he had seen a better ring or even
one as good as this.</p>

<p>"Since you evidently think it strange," said he,
"that I make so little of it, I may say that I have
certainly seen gold which is in no way inferior, but
actually better."</p>

<p>The King's men now laughed heartily and said
that that promised good sport, adding:</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page19" id="page19"></a>[pg 19]</span>

<p>"Will you agree to wager with us that you have
seen gold as good as this, and prove it? We will stake
four marks in current coin against your knife and
belt; and the King shall decide who is in the right."</p>

<p>Then said Guest: "I will neither be made a
laughing-stock for you nor fail to keep the wager
which you offer. And I will certainly lay a wager
with you on the spot, and stake exactly what you
have suggested, and the King shall judge who is in
the right."</p>

<p>Then they stopped talking, and Guest took his
harp and played it well till far into the evening, so
that it was a joy to all who heard him. What he
rendered best was <i>The Harping of Gunnar</i>; and last
of all he played the ancient <i>Wiles of Guthrun</i>,
neither of which they had heard before. And after
that they went to sleep for the night.</p>

<p class="indent">III. &nbsp;In the morning the King rose early and heard
Mass; and after that he went to breakfast with
his retinue. And when he had taken his place in the
high seat, the guests came up to him, and Guest with
them; and they told him all about their agreement
and the wager which they had made.</p>

<p>"I am not much taken with your wager," replied
the King, "although it is your own money that you
are staking. I suspect that the drink must have
gone to your heads; and I think you would do well
to give it up, especially if Guest agrees."</p>

<p>"My wish is," replied Guest, "that the whole
agreement should stand."</p>

<p>"It looks to me, Guest," said the King, "as if it
was my men rather than you whose tongues have got
them into trouble; but we will soon put it to the test."</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page20" id="page20"></a>[pg 20]</span>

<p>After that they left him and went to drink; and
when the drinking tables were removed, the King
summoned Guest and spoke to him as follows:</p>

<p>"Now is the time for you to produce the gold if
you have any, so that I can decide your wager."</p>

<p>"As you will, Sire!" replied Guest.</p>

<p>Then he felt in a pouch which he had with him,
and took out of it a fob which he untied, and then
handed something to the King.</p>

<p>The King saw that it was a piece of a saddle-buckle
and that it was of exceedingly fine gold.
Then he bade them bring the ring Hnituth; and
when they did so, the King compared the ring and
the piece of gold and said:</p>

<p>"I have no doubt whatever that the gold which
Guest has shown us is the finer, and anyone who
looks at it must think so too."</p>

<p>Everybody agreed with the King. Then he decided
the wager in Guest's favour, and the other guests
came to the conclusion that they had made fools of
themselves over the business.</p>

<p>Then Guest said: "Take your money and keep it
yourselves, for I don't need it; but don't make any
more wagers with strangers, for you never know
when you may hit upon someone who has both seen
and heard more than you have.&mdash;I thank you, Sire,
for your decision!"</p>

<p>Then the King said: "Now I want you to tell me
where you got that gold from, which you carry about
with you."</p>

<p>Guest replied: "I am loth to tell you, because no-one
will believe what I have to say about it."</p>

<p>"Let us hear it all the same," said the King, "for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page21" id="page21"></a>[pg 21]</span>
you promised before that you would tell us your
story."</p>

<p>"If I tell you the history of this piece of gold,"
replied Guest, "I expect you will want to hear the
rest of my story along with it."</p>

<p>"I expect that that is just what will happen,"
said the King.</p>

<a name="n4" id="n4"></a>
<p class="indent">IV.<a href="#nn4">°</a> &nbsp;"Then I will tell you how once I went south
into the land of the Franks. I wanted to see for myself
what sort of a prince Sigurth the son of Sigmund
was, and to discover if the reports which had reached
me of his great beauty and courage were true.
Nothing happened worth mentioning until I came
to the land of the Franks and met King Hjalprek.
He had a great court around him. Sigurth, the son
of Sigmund, the son of Völsung, and of Hjördis, the
daughter of Eylimi, was there at that time. Sigmund
had fallen in battle against the sons of Hunding, and
Hjördis had married Alf the son of King Hjalprek.
There Sigurth grew up together with all the other
sons of King Sigmund. Among these were Sinfjötli
and Helgi, who surpassed all men in strength and
stature. Helgi slew King Hunding, thereby earning
the name Hundingsbani. The third son was called
Hamund. Sigurth, however, outstripped all his
brothers, and it is a well-known fact that he was the
noblest of all warrior princes, and the very model of
a king in heathen times.</p>

<p>At that time, Regin, the son of Hreithmar, had
also come to King Hjalprek. He was a dwarf in
stature, but there was no-one more cunning than he.
He was a wise man, but malign and skilled in magic.
Regin taught Sigurth many things and was devoted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page22" id="page22"></a>[pg 22]</span>
to him. He told him about his birth and his wondrous
adventures.</p>

<p>And when I had been there a little while, I
entered Sigurth's service like many others. He was
very popular with everybody, because he was friendly
and unassuming, and generous to all.</p>

<a name="n5" id="n5"></a>
<p class="indent">V.<a href="#nn5">°</a> &nbsp;It chanced one day that we came to Regin's
house and Sigurth was made welcome there. Then
Regin spoke these verses:</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>The son of Sigmund cometh to our hall,</p>
<p>A valiant warrior. It must needs befall</p>
<p>That I, less doughty and oppressed with age,</p>
<p>Shall fall a victim to his wolfish rage.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>But I will cherish Yngvi's valorous heir,</p>
<p>Since Fate hath sent him hither to our care,</p>
<p>Train him to be, in valour and in worth,</p>
<p>The mightiest and most famous prince on earth.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>At this time, Sigurth was constantly in Regin's
company. Regin told him much about Fafnir&mdash;how
he dwelt upon Gnitaheith in the form of a serpent,
and also of his wondrous size. Regin made for
Sigurth a sword called Gram. It was so sharp that
when he thrust it into the River Rhine it cut in
two a flock of wool which he had dropped into the
river and which was drifting down stream, cutting
it just as clean as it did the water itself. Later on,
Sigurth clove Regin's stithy with the sword. After
that Regin urged Sigurth to slay his brother Fafnir
and Sigurth recited this verse:</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>The sons of Hunding would laugh loud and high,</p>
<p>Who shed the life-blood of King Eylimi,</p>
<p>If that his grandson bold should more desire</p>
<p>Rings of red gold than vengeance for his sire.</p>
  </div>  </div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page23" id="page23"></a>[pg 23]</span>

<p>After that Sigurth made ready an expedition to
attack the sons of Hunding; and King Hjalprek gave
him many men and some warships. Hamund,
Sisurth's brother, was with him on this venture,
and so was Regin the dwarf. I was present too, and
they called me Nornagest. King Hjalprek had got
to know me when he was in Denmark with Sigmund
the son of Völsung. At that time, Sigmund was
married to Borghild, but they parted because
Borghild killed Sinfjötli the son of Sigmund by
poison. Then Sigmund went south to the land of
the Franks and married Hjördis, the daughter of
King Eylimi. The sons of Hunding slew him, so
Sigurth had both his father and grandfather to
avenge.</p>

<p>Helgi, the son of Sigmund, who was called
Hundingsbani, was the brother of Sigurth who was
afterwards called Fafnisbani. Helgi, Sigurth's
brother, had slain King Hunding and three of his
sons, Eyjulf, Hervarth, and Hjörvarth, but Lyngvi
and his two remaining brothers, Alf and Heming,
escaped. They were exceedingly famous for exploits
and accomplishments of every kind; but Lyngvi
surpassed all his brothers. They were very skilled in
magic. They had reduced many petty kings to subjection,
and slain many champions, and burnt many
cities. They had worked the greatest havoc with
their raids in Spain and in the land of the Franks.
But at that time the Imperial Power had not yet
been transferred to the regions north of the Alps.
The sons of Hunding had seized the realm which
had belonged to Sigurth in the land of the Franks,
and they had very large forces there.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page24" id="page24"></a>[pg 24]</span>

<a name="n6" id="n6"></a>
<p class="indent">VI.<a href="#nn6">°</a> &nbsp;Now I must tell you how Sigurth prepared
for battle against the sons of Hunding. He had got
together a large and well-armed host, and Regin was
a mighty man in the councils of the force. He had
a sword which was called Rithil and which he had
forged himself. Sigurth asked Regin to lend him
the sword. He did so, begging him to slay Fafnir
when he should return from this adventure, and this
Sigurth promised to do.</p>

<p>After that we sailed away south along the coast,
and then we met with a great storm raised by witchcraft,
and many believed that it had been stirred up
by the sons of Hunding. After this we hugged the
shore somewhat more closely, and then we saw a
man on a rocky promontory which jutted out from
the cliffs. He wore a green cloak and dark breeches,
and had high laced boots on his feet, and carried a
spear in his hand. This man addressed us in the
following stanza:</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>What folk are ye who ride the sea-king's steed,</p>
<p>Mounting the lofty billows, and proceed</p>
<p>Athwart the tossing main? Drenched is your sail,</p>
<p>Nor can your ships against the wind prevail.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p class="ind1">Regin replied:</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Hither come we with Sigurth o'er the foam,</p>
<p>Whom ocean breezes blow to our last home.&mdash;</p>
<p>Full soon the breakers, higher than the prow</p>
<p>Will sink our 'ocean-steeds'; but who art thou?</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p class="ind1">The man in the cloak replied:</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Hnikar the name men did for me employ,</p>
<p>Young Völsung, when I gave the raven joy</p>
<p>Of carnage. Call me either of the two&mdash;</p>
<p>Fjölnir or Feng, but let me fare with you.</p>
  </div>  </div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page25" id="page25"></a>[pg 25]</span>

<p>Then we steered towards the land and the wind
fell immediately; and Sigurth bade the man come
on board. He did so, and a fair breeze sprang up.
The man sat down at Sigurth's feet and was very
friendly, asking if Sigurth would like to hear some
advice from him. Sigurth said that he would, and
added that he had an idea that Hnikar could give
people very helpful advice if he were willing to turn
it to their advantage. Then Sigurth said to the man
in the cloak:</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>O Hnikar, since you know the destiny</p>
<p>Of gods and men, declare this unto me.&mdash;</p>
<p>Which are the omens that should most delight</p>
<p>When swords are swinging and a man must fight?</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p class="ind1">Hnikar replied:</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Many propitious signs, if men could know,</p>
<p>Appear when swords are swinging to and fro.</p>
<p>I hold a warrior has a trusty guide</p>
<p>When a dark raven hovers at his side.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>I hold it too for a propitious sign</p>
<p>If men to make a journey should design,</p>
<p>And, coming out of doors, see close at hand</p>
<p>Two gallant warriors in the pathway stand.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>And if you hear beneath the rowan tree</p>
<p>A howling wolf, the sound spells luck to thee,</p>
<p>And luck shall helmed warriors bring to thee,</p>
<p>If thou such warriors art the first to see.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>Facing the sinking and late shining light</p>
<p>Of the Moon's sister, warriors should not fight.</p>
<p>Victory is theirs who, eager for the fray,</p>
<p>Can clearly see to order their array.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>I hold it no occasion for delight</p>
<p>When a man stumbles as he goes to fight;</p>
<p>For guileful spirits dog him on his way</p>
<p>With mischief-bearing looks throughout the fray</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page26" id="page26"></a>[pg 26]</span>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>A man of wisdom, as each day goes past,</p>
<p>Washes, and combs his hair, and breaks his fast.</p>
<p>He knows not where by evening he may be.&mdash;</p>
<p>Stumbling is bad luck, boding ill to thee.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>And after that we sailed southwards along the
coast of Holstein and to the east of Friesland, and
there we landed. The sons of Hunding heard at once
of our expedition and gathered an army; and they
soon had a larger force than we had, and when we
encountered them there was a great battle. Lyngvi
was the most valiant of the brothers in every onset,
though they all fought bravely. Sigurth's attack was
so fierce that everyone shrank before him, when they
saw that they were threatened by the sword Gram.
There was no need to reproach Sigurth with lack of
courage. And when he and Lyngvi met, they exchanged
many blows and fought with the greatest
valour. Then there was a lull in the battle, for people
turned to watch the single combat. For a long time
neither of them was able to inflict a wound on the
other, so skilled in arms were they.</p>

<p>Then Lyngvi's brothers made a fierce attack and
slew many of our men, while others took to flight. Then
Hamund, Sigurth's brother, rushed to meet them, and
I joined him, and then there was another encounter.</p>

<p>The end of the affair between Sigurth and Lyngvi
was that Sigurth made him prisoner and had him
fettered. And when Sigurth joined us, matters very
soon changed. Then the sons of Hunding fell and
all their host; but then night was coming on. And
when day dawned, Hnikar had vanished, and he was
never seen again. We came to the conclusion that it
must in reality have been Othin.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page27" id="page27"></a>[pg 27]</span>

<p>A discussion then took place as to what death
Lyngvi should suffer; Regin counselled that the
'blood eagle' should be carved on his back. Then
I handed to Regin his sword and with it he carved
Lyngvi's back till he had severed the ribs from the
spine; and then he drew out the lungs. Thus died
Lyngvi with great courage.</p>

<p class="ind1">Then Regin said:</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Full seldom has a bolder warrior</p>
<p>Reddened the earth than Sigmund's murderer.</p>
<p>Hugin he feasted. Now with biting sword</p>
<p>The 'bloody eagle' on his back is scored.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Great spoil was taken there. Sigurth's sailors got
the whole of it because he would not take any
himself. The clothes and weapons taken were worth
much gold.</p>

<p>Afterwards Sigurth slew Fafnir, and Regin also,
because Regin had intended to deal treacherously
with him. Sigurth took Fafnir's gold and rode away
with it, and from that time on he was called Fafnisbani.</p>

<p>After that he rode up to Hindarheith where he
found Brynhild. What passed between them is told
in the story of Sigurth Fafnisbani.</p>

<a name="n7" id="n7"></a>
<p class="indent">VII.<a href="#nn7">°</a> &nbsp;Later on Sigurth married Guthrun the
daughter of King Gjuki and then stayed for a while
with his brothers-in-law, the sons of Gjuki. I returned
to the North with Sigurth and was with him
in Denmark, and I was also with him when Sigurth
Hring sent his brothers-in-law, the sons of Gandalf,
to Gunnar and Högni, the sons of Gjuki, and demanded
that they should pay him tribute, threatening
them with invasion in case they refused. But they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page28" id="page28"></a>[pg 28]</span>
decided to defend their country. Thereupon Gandalf's
sons challenged the sons of Gjuki to a pitched battle
on the frontier, and then returned home; but the
sons of Gjuki asked Sigurth Fafnisbani to go to
battle with them, and he agreed to do so. I was still
with Sigurth at that time. Then we sailed again
northwards along the coast of Holstein and landed
at a place called Jarnamotha. Not far from the
landing place hazel-wood poles had been set up to
mark where the fight was to take place.</p>

<p>Then we saw many ships sailing from the north
under the command of the sons of Gandalf. Then the
two hosts charged one another fiercely. Sigurth
Hring was not there, because he had to defend his
own land, Sweden, against the inroads of the Kurir
and Kvænir. Sigurth was a very old man at that
time. Then the forces came into collision, and there
was a great battle and much slaughter. The sons of
Gandalf fought bravely, for they were exceptionally
big and strong.</p>

<p>In that host there appeared a big strong man who
made such slaughter of men and horses that no-one
could withstand him, for he was more like a giant
than a man. Gunnar bade Sigurth go and attack
the scoundrel, adding that as things were, there
would be no success. So Sigurth made ready to
encounter the mighty man, and some others went
with him, but most of them were far from eager.</p>

<p>We quickly came upon the mighty man, and
Sigurth asked him his name and whence he came.
He said that he was Starkath, the son of Storverk,
and that he came from the North, from Fenhring
in Norway. Sigurth said that he had heard reports
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page29" id="page29"></a>[pg 29]</span>
of him and generally little to his credit, adding that
no mercy ought to be shown towards such people.</p>

<p>Starkath said: "Who is this man who casts insults
in my teeth?"</p>

<p>Sigurth told him who he was.</p>

<p>Starkath said: "Are you called Fafnisbani?"</p>

<p>Sigurth said he was.</p>

<p>Then Starkath sought to escape, but Sigurth
pursued him and swung aloft the sword Gram and
struck him on the jaw with the hilt so hard that two
molars fell out of his mouth; it was a stunning blow.</p>

<p>Then Sigurth bade the cur take himself off, and
Starkath went away, and I picked up one of the teeth
and carried it off with me. It is now used on a bell-rope
at Lund in Denmark and weighs seven ounces;
and people go and look at it there as a curiosity.</p>

<p>As soon as Starkath had run away, the sons of
Gandalf took to flight, and we captured great booty;
and after that Sigurth went home to his realm and
remained there for a while.</p>

<a name="n8" id="n8"></a>
<p class="indent">VIII.<a href="#nn8">°</a> &nbsp;A short time after, we heard that Starkath
had committed a foul murder, slaying King Ali in
his bath.</p>

<p>It chanced one day that as Sigurth Fafnisbani was
riding to some gathering or other, he rode into a
muddy pool, and his horse Grani leapt up so wildly
that his saddle-girth burst asunder and the buckle
fell to the ground. And when I saw where it lay
shining in the mud, I picked it up and handed it to
Sigurth; but he said that I might keep it. It was that
very piece of gold that you were looking at a short
time ago. Then Sigurth got down from his horse, and
I rubbed it down and washed the mud off it; and I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page30" id="page30"></a>[pg 30]</span>
pulled a lock of hair out of its tail as a proof of its
great size."</p>

<p>Then Guest showed the lock and it was seven ells
long.</p>

<p>King Olaf said: "I think your stories are very
entertaining."</p>

<p>Everybody praised his stories and his talent.</p>

<p>Then the King wanted him to tell them much
more about the adventures he had met with on his
travels. So Guest told them many amusing stories
till late in the evening. It was then time to go to bed;
but next morning the King sent for Guest, and wanted
to talk to him still further.</p>

<p>The King said: "I can't quite make out your age
and how you can be old enough to have been present
when these events took place. You will have to tell
another story so as to make us better acquainted with
things of this kind."</p>

<p>Guest replied: "I suspected before that you would
want to hear another of my stories, if I told you what
had happened about the gold."</p>

<p>"You must certainly tell me some more," replied
the King.</p>

<a name="n9" id="n9"></a>
<p class="indent">IX.<a href="#nn9">°</a> &nbsp;"I must tell you then," Guest began, "that
I went north to Denmark and there settled down on
my estate, for my father had died a short time before;
and a little later I heard of the death of Sigurth and
the sons of Gjuki, and I felt that that was news indeed."</p>

<p>"What was the cause of Sigurth's death?" asked
the King.</p>

<p>Guest replied: "It is generally believed that
Guthorm the son of Gjuki ran a sword through him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page31" id="page31"></a>[pg 31]</span>
while he was asleep in bed with Guthrun. On the
other hand, Germans say that Sigurth was slain out
in the forest. In the <i>Guthrúnar-rætha</i> again it is
stated that Sigurth and the sons of Gjuki had ridden
to a gathering and that they slew him then. But one
thing is agreed by all&mdash;that they set on him when he
was down and off his guard, and that they were
guilty of gross treachery towards him."</p>

<p>Then one of the retinue asked:</p>

<p>"How did Brynhild behave then?"</p>

<p>Guest answered: "Brynhild then slew seven of her
slaves and five handmaidens, and ran herself through
with a sword, commanding that she should be taken
to the pyre along with these people and burned
beside Sigurth. This was done, one pile being made
for Sigurth and another for Brynhild, and he was
burned first, and then Brynhild. She was taken in a
chariot with a canopy of velvet and silk which was
all ablaze with gold, and thus was she burnt."</p>

<p>Then Guest was asked if Brynhild had chanted a
lay after she was dead. He replied that she had, and
they asked him to recite it if he could.</p>

<p>Then Guest said: "As Brynhild was being driven
to the pyre on the way to Hell, she was brought near
some cliffs where an ogress dwelt. The ogress was
standing outside the doors of her cave and wore a
skin kirtle and was of a blackish hue. She carried a
long faggot in her hand and cried:</p>

<p>'This will I contribute to your burning, Brynhild.
It would have been better if you had been burned while
you were still alive, before you were guilty of getting
such a splendid man as Sigurth Fafnisbani slain. I was
always friendly to him and therefore I shall attack
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page32" id="page32"></a>[pg 32]</span>
you in a reproachful song which will make you hated
by everybody who hears what you have done.'</p>

<p>After that Brynhild and the ogress chanted to
one another.</p>

<p class="ind1">The ogress sang as follows:</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Thou shalt not be suffered to pass through my courts</p>
<p class="i2">With their pillars of stone in my mansion drear,&mdash;</p>
<p>Better far wert thou busied at home with thy needle!</p>

  </div>  </div>

<p class="ind1">Then cried Brynhild:</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">

<p>Then the ogress gave a horrible shriek and leapt
into the cliff."</p>

<p>Then the King's followers cried: "That's fine!
Go on and tell us some more!"</p>

<p>But the King said: "You need not tell us any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page34" id="page34"></a>[pg 34]</span>
more about things of that kind." Then he continued:
"Were you ever with the sons of Lothbrok?"</p>

<p>Guest replied: "I was only with them for a short
time; I joined them when they were making an
expedition to the south in the neighbourhood of the
Alps, and when they destroyed Vifilsborg. Panic
spread everywhere at their approach, for they were
victorious wherever they went. They were intending
at the time to go to Rome. It chanced one day that
a certain man came up to King Björn Ironside and
saluted him. The King received him in a friendly
way and asked him whence he came. He said that
he had come from the south, from Rome.</p>

<p>The King asked him: 'How long is the journey
there?'</p>

<p>He replied: 'You can see here, O King, the shoes
which I am wearing.'</p>

<p>Then he took iron-bound shoes from his feet, and
the tops of them were very thick, but underneath
they were all torn.</p>

<p>'You can see now how severely my shoes have
suffered,' said he, 'and tell by that what a long way
it is from here to Rome.'</p>

<p>'It must be a very long way,' said the King;
'I shall turn back and give up the idea of attacking
the territories of Rome.'</p>

<p>And the result was that they went no further on
their way; and everyone thought it extraordinary
that they should change their minds so suddenly at
the word of one man, when they had all their plans
laid. So after this the sons of Lothbrok went back
to their homes in the north, and made no further
raids in the south."</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page35" id="page35"></a>[pg 35]</span>

<p>The King said: "It is clear that the saints in Rome
would not allow them to make their way there. The
man you spoke of must have been a Spirit sent from
God to make them change their minds so quickly,
so as not to bring destruction on Rome, the most holy
place of Jesus Christ."</p>

<a name="n10" id="n10"></a>
<p class="indent">X.<a href="#nn10">°</a> &nbsp;Then the King asked Guest: "Amongst the
kings whom you have visited, whose was the court
that you liked best?"</p>

<p>Guest replied: "I enjoyed most being with Sigurth
and the sons of Gjuki; but the sons of Lothbrok
were those who allowed most freedom to their
followers to live as they liked. Then again the richest
place was that of Eric at Upsala; but King Harold
the Fairhaired was more exacting than any of the
kings I have mentioned in the duties that he imposed
on his followers. I was with King Hlöthver too in
the land of the Saxons, and there I was prime-signed;
for it was not possible to remain with him otherwise,
because the Christian religion was carefully observed
there. That was the place I liked best on the whole."</p>

<p>The King said: "You can give us a great deal
of information whatever question we ask you."</p>

<p>The King then asked Guest many further questions,
and Guest told him everything clearly, and finally he
said:</p>

<p>"Now I must tell you why I am called Norna-gest."</p>

<p>The King said he would like to hear.</p>

<p class="indent">XI. &nbsp;Guest began: "I was brought up at my
father's home at a place called Groening. My
father was a wealthy man and kept house in great
style. At that time wise women used to go about the
country. They were called 'spae-wives,' and they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page36" id="page36"></a>[pg 36]</span>
foretold people's futures. For this reason people used
to invite them to their houses and gave them hospitality
and bestowed gifts on them at parting.</p>

<p>My father did the same, and they came to him
with a great following to foretell my fate. I was lying
in my cradle when the time came for them to prophesy
about me, and two candles were burning above
me. Then they foretold that I should be a favourite
of Fortune, and a greater man than any of my kindred
or forbears&mdash;greater even than the sons of the chief
men in the land; and they said that all would come
to pass just as it has done. But the youngest Norn
thought that she was not receiving enough attention
compared with the other two, since they were
held in high account yet did not consult her about
these prophecies. There was also a great crowd of
roughs present, who pushed her off her seat, so that
she fell to the ground. She was much vexed at this
and called out loudly and angrily, telling them to
stop prophesying such good things about me:</p>

<p>'For I ordain that the boy shall live no longer than
that candle burns which is alight beside him.'</p>

<p>Then the eldest spae-wife took the candle and
extinguished it and bade my mother take charge of
it and not light it until the last day of my life. After
that the spae-wives went away, and my father gave
them good gifts at parting. When I was full-grown,
my mother gave me the candle to take charge of: I
have it with me now."</p>

<p>The King said: "Why have you come here to me
now?"</p>

<p>Guest replied: "The idea that came into my mind
was this: I expected that I should get good luck from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page37" id="page37"></a>[pg 37]</span>
you, because I have heard you highly praised by good
and wise men."</p>

<p>The King said: "Will you receive holy baptism
now?"</p>

<p>Guest replied: "Yes, I will, since you advise it."</p>

<p>So it came to pass; and the King took him into
his favour and made him one of his retinue. Guest
became a very good Christian and loyally followed
the King's rules of life. He was also popular with
everybody.</p>

<a name="n12" id="n12"></a>
<p class="indent">XII.<a href="#nn12">°</a> &nbsp;It happened one day that the King asked
Guest: "How much longer would you live if you
could choose?"</p>

<p>Guest replied: "Only a short time, please God!"</p>

<p>The King said: "What will happen if you take
your candle now?"</p>

<p>Thereupon Guest took his candle out of the frame
of his harp. The King ordered it to be lighted, and
this was done. And when the candle was lighted it
soon began to burn away.</p>

<p>Then the King said to Guest: "How old are you?"</p>

<p>And Guest replied: "I am now three hundred
years old."</p>

<p>"You are an old man," observed the King.</p>

<p>Then Guest laid himself down and asked them
to anoint him with oil. The King ordered it to be
done, and when it was finished there was very little
of the candle left unburnt. Then it became clear
that Guest was drawing near to his end, and his
spirit passed just as the torch flickered out; and they
all marvelled at his passing. The King also set great
store by his stories and held that the account which
he had given of his life was perfectly true.</p>

<h3 style="margin-top: 3em;">INTRODUCTION TO THE THÁTTR OF SÖRLI</h3>

<p>This story, like the last, is taken from the long
<i>Saga of Olaf Tryggvason</i> contained in the <i>Flateyjarbók</i>,
Vol. <span class="sc">i</span>, pp. 275-283. Its connection, however, with
the story of that King is of the slightest. According
to the opinion of Finnur Jónsson<a id="footnotetagii1" name="footnotetagii1"></a><a href="#footnoteii1"><sup>1</sup></a> the story in its
present form dates from the first half of the fourteenth
century.</p>

<p>This story, like the <i>Tháttr of Nornagest</i>, shows
evidence of a definite structural plan and falls into
three distinct parts. In the first two chapters the
scene is laid among the gods, and the story is set
in motion by the forging of a necklace for the goddess
Freyja by some dwarfs. This is stolen by Loki and
given to Othin, who refuses to restore it to Freyja
till she promises to bring about a perpetual battle
between two mighty kings.</p>

<p>Then in chs. <span class="sc">iii</span> and <span class="sc">iv</span> we have an account of the
adventures of a Viking prince named Sörli, from
whom the story takes its (somewhat inappropriate)
title<a id="footnotetagii2" name="footnotetagii2"></a><a href="#footnoteii2"><sup>2</sup></a>. Sörli comes into contact (first as an enemy,
later as a friend) with another prince called Högni,
and this leads up to the main theme&mdash;the friendship
and subsequent quarrel of Hethin and Högni, in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page39" id="page39"></a>[pg 39]</span>
whose tragic fate Freyja's promise is fulfilled. The
perpetual battle between these two heroes is finally
ended by one of Olaf Tryggvason's men, and it is
through this that the story comes to be introduced
into his Saga.</p>

<p>The story of Hethin and Högni was a favourite
one in the North. It is told in <i>Skáldskaparmál</i>,
ch. 49 and in Saxo Grammaticus' <i>Danish History</i>,
Book <span class="sc">v</span> (Elton, pp. 195-198). The earliest Norse
reference to it is to be found in Bragi's <i>Ragnarsdrápa</i>,
str. 3-7. The story must also have been well known
in the Orkneys, since we find the following verses
in the <i>Háttalykill</i> by Jarl Rögnvald (1136-58) and
an Icelandic skald Hall who flourished 1140-48<a id="footnotetagii3" name="footnotetagii3"></a><a href="#footnoteii3"><sup>3</sup></a>.</p>

<p>In the Shetlands the story survived down to
modern times in the form of a ballad known as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page40" id="page40"></a>[pg 40]</span>
<i>Hildina</i>, which was taken down by George Low<a id="footnotetagii4" name="footnotetagii4"></a><a href="#footnoteii4"><sup>4</sup></a>
from the recitation of an old man on the Isle of Foula
in 1774. The Norwegian dialect (Norn) in which it
is composed is so obscure as we have it in Low's
script as to be almost untranslatable, though a
serious attempt at its interpretation has been made
by Dr M. Hægstad in <i>Skrifter udgivne af Videnskabsselskabet
i Christiania</i>, 1900 (<i>Historisk-Filosofisk
Klasse</i>, <span class="sc">ii</span>), with a very full discussion of all the linguistic
difficulties involved<a id="footnotetagii5" name="footnotetagii5"></a><a href="#footnoteii5"><sup>5</sup></a>. According to Low
"The subject is a strife between a King of Norway
and an Earl of Orkney, on account of the hasty
marriage of the Earl with the King's daughter in
her father's absence." Further on<a id="footnotetagii6" name="footnotetagii6"></a><a href="#footnoteii6"><sup>6</sup></a> he gives the
substance of the ballad at greater length:</p>

<blockquote><p>
An Earl of Orkney, in some of his rambles on the coast of
Norway, saw and fell in love with the King's daughter of
the country. As their passion happened to be reciprocal he
carried her off in her father's absence, who was engaged in
war with some of his distant neighbours. On his return, he
followed the fugitives to Orkney, accompanied by his army,
to revenge on the Earl the rape of his daughter. On his
arrival there, Hildina (which was her name) first spied him,
and advised her now husband to go and attempt to pacify the
King. He did so, and by his appearance and promises brought
the King so over as to be satisfied with the match.
</p></blockquote>

<p>After this, with the introduction of a courtier
Hiluge the story proceeds in a form totally different
from anything found in the <i>tháttr</i>, though an attempt
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page41" id="page41"></a>[pg 41]</span>
has been made to connect it with the second part
of the German poem <i>Kudrun</i>.</p>

<p>The story of Hethin and Högni however was not
confined to Norway and its colonies; indeed it seems
to have been popular throughout the whole Teutonic
world. It forms the subject of the first part of the
mediaeval German poem <i>Kudrun</i>, and characters from
the story are mentioned in the Anglo-Saxon poems
<i>Widsith</i>, l. 21, and <i>Deor</i>, l. 36 ff.</p>

<p>For a treatment of the different versions of the
story as it was known to men of old, the reader may
be referred to Miss Clarke's <i>Sidelights on Teutonic
History during the Migration Period</i> (Cambridge, 1911),
p. 190 ff., and to Chambers' <i>Widsith</i>, p. 100 ff. It
may be mentioned here that in the main points of
the story&mdash;the carrying off of Hild and the subsequent
pursuit by the father&mdash;all the versions are
agreed. The German version, however, differs in
many respects from those of the North (except that
of the <i>Hildina</i>)&mdash;especially in the fact that the combatants
become reconciled. The various Scandinavian
versions of the story also differ somewhat in detail
among themselves. The story translated below is the
only one which mentions the slaying by Hethin of
Högni's wife, and it is only here that Hethin is
described as being of foreign origin. Moreover this
is the only version in which the goddess Freyja is
made responsible for the Unending Battle. Indeed
the supernatural element, and especially the influence
of charms and spells, is more prominent in this version
than in any of the others. It is only here, too, that
we find the story of Göndul and the "potion of
forgetfulness." On the other hand our version
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page42" id="page42"></a>[pg 42]</span>
contains no reference to the statement made in
<i>Skáldskaparmál</i> and Saxo that it was Hild who by
her magic spells restored the dead to life each night.</p>

<p>In our version of the story the character of
Hild is left wholly undeveloped. Indeed the writers
of the Romantic Sagas are always so much more
interested in incident than in character that highly
individualised personality is rare. Even when as
in the case of Hervör<a id="footnotetagii7" name="footnotetagii7"></a><a href="#footnoteii7"><sup>7</sup></a>, the very nature of the
story presents an interesting and somewhat unusual
personality, we are sometimes left with a feeling of
dissatisfaction and a conviction that the writer did
not realise the full merits and possibilities of his
material. Högni is the usual type of hot-headed
implacable sea-rover. The character of Hethin,
however, presents some interesting features and
strikes us as more modern in conception. Naturally
gentle of disposition, he had been forced by malignant
powers into a situation foreign to his nature. Hardly
characteristic of a viking chief are his genuine regret
for the harm he had done and his anxiety that the men
of Högni and himself should not be called upon to
forfeit their lives for his "crimes and misdeeds." The
conventional viking, clear-eyed and purely material in
his view of life, would have stayed to brave out the
consequences. Hethin only wished "to go away somewhere
a long way off, where he would not each day
have his wicked deeds cast in his teeth." His remorse
had broken him down.&mdash;"You will find it an easy
matter to slay me when I am left alive last of all!"</p>

<p>The motif of the Everlasting Battle is not confined
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page43" id="page43"></a>[pg 43]</span>
the story of Hethin and Högni. Parallels can be
found in many literatures, both ancient and modern<a id="footnotetagii8" name="footnotetagii8"></a><a href="#footnoteii8"><sup>8</sup></a>.</p>

<h3 style="margin-top: 3em;">THE THÁTTR OF SÖRLI<a href="#ns1">°</a></h3>

<p class="indent">I. &nbsp;To the East of Vanakvisl in Asia was a country
called Asialand or Asiaheim. Its inhabitants were
called Æsir and the chief city they called Asgarth.
Othin was the name of their King, and it was a great
place for heathen sacrifices. Othin appointed Njörth
and Frey as priests. Njörth had a daughter called
Freyja who accompanied Othin and was his mistress.
There were four men in Asia called Alfregg, Dvalin,
Berling and Grer, who dwelt not far from the King's
hall, and who were so clever that they could turn
their hands to anything. Men of this kind were
called dwarfs. They dwelt in a rock, but at that time
they mixed more with men than they do now. Othin
loved Freyja very much, and she was the fairest of
all women in her day. She had a bower of her own
which was beautiful and strong, and it was said that
if the door was closed and bolted, no-one could enter
the bower against her will.</p>

<p>It chanced one day that Freyja went to the rock
and found it open, and the dwarfs were forging a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page44" id="page44"></a>[pg 44]</span>
gold necklace, which was almost finished. Freyja
was charmed with the necklace, and the dwarfs with
Freyja. She asked them to sell it, offering gold and
silver and other costly treasures in exchange for it.
The dwarfs replied that they were not in need of
money, but each one said that he would give up his
share in the necklace.... And at the end of four nights
they handed it to Freyja. She went home to her bower
and kept silence about it as if nothing had happened.</p>

<a name="s2" id="s2"></a>
<p class="indent">II.<a href="#ns2">°</a> &nbsp;There was a man called Farbauti who was a
peasant and had a wife called Laufey. She was thin
and meagre, and so she was called 'Needle.' They
had no children except a son who was called Loki.
He was not a big man, but he early developed a caustic
tongue and was alert in trickery and unequalled in
that kind of cleverness which is called cunning. He
was very full of guile even in his youth, and for this
reason he was called Loki the Sly. He set off to
Othin's home in Asgarth and became his man.
Othin always had a good word for him whatever
he did, and often laid heavy tasks upon him, all
of which he performed better than could have been
expected. He also knew almost everything that
happened, and he told Othin whatever he knew.</p>

<p>Now it is said that Loki got to know that Freyja
had received the necklace ... and this he told to Othin.
And when Othin heard of it he told Loki to fetch
him the necklace. Loki said that there was not much
hope of that, because no-one could get into Freyja's
bower against her will. Othin told him to go, and
not come back without the necklace. So Loki went
off howling, and everyone was glad that he had
got into trouble.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page45" id="page45"></a>[pg 45]</span>

<p>He went to Freyja's bower, but it was locked. He
tried to get in but could not. The weather outside
was very cold and he became thoroughly chilled.
Then he turned himself into a fly, and flew around
all the bolts and along the whole of the woodwork,
but nowhere could he find a hole big enough to
enter by, right up to the gable. He found only a hole
no bigger than would allow of the insertion of a needle.
Through this hole he crept. And when he got inside
he stared around, wondering if anyone was awake. But
he found that the room was all wrapped in slumber.</p>

<p>Then he went in and up to Freyja's bed and found
that she was wearing the necklace and that the clasp
was underneath her. Loki thereupon turned himself
into a flea and settled on Freyja's cheek and stung
her, till she awoke and turned over and went to sleep
again. Then he laid aside his flea-form, drew the
necklace from her gently, opened the door and
departed, carrying the necklace to Othin.</p>

<p>When Freyja awoke in the morning she found that
the door was open, though it had not been forced,
and that her lovely necklace was gone. She had a
shrewd idea of the trick that had been played on her,
and when she was dressed she went into the hall to
King Othin, and told him that he had done ill to
rob her of her trinket, and begged him to return it.</p>

<p>Othin replied that considering how she had come
by it she should never get it back:</p>

<p>"&mdash;Unless you bring about a quarrel between two
kings, each of whom has twenty kings subject to him;
so that they shall fight under the influence of such
spells and charms that as fast as they fall they shall
start up again and fight on&mdash;unless there be some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page46" id="page46"></a>[pg 46]</span>
Christian man so brave and so much favoured by the
great good fortune of his liege lord that he shall dare
to take arms and enter among the combatants and
slay them. Then and not till then shall the labours of
those princes be brought to an end&mdash;whoever may be
the chief who is destined to free them from the
oppression and toil of their disastrous lot."</p>

<p>Freyja agreed to this and recovered the necklace.</p>

<a name="s3" id="s3"></a>
<p class="indent">III.<a href="#ns3">°</a> &nbsp;Four and twenty years after the death of
Frithfrothi a King called Erling ruled over the
Highlands of Norway. He had a wife and two sons,
of whom the elder was called Sörli the Strong, and
the younger Erlend. They were promising young
men. Sörli was the stronger of the two. As soon
as they were old enough they took to raiding, and
fought against the viking Sindri, the son of Sveigir,
the son of Haki, a sea-king in the Skerries of the Elf.
There fell Sindri the viking, and with him all his
host; and Erlend the son of Erling also fell in that
battle. After that Sörli sailed into the Baltic and
harried there, and performed so many great deeds
that it would take too long to recount them all.</p>

<a name="s4" id="s4"></a>
<p class="indent">IV.<a href="#ns4">°</a> &nbsp;There was a King called Halfdan who ruled
Denmark; and his capital was at Roskilde. He
married Hvethna the elder, and their sons were
Högni and Haakon. They were distinguished for
their stature, strength and ability. As soon as they
were old enough they took to piracy.</p>

<p>Now we must return to Sörli and relate how one
autumn he set sail for Denmark. King Halfdan had
been intending to go to a gathering of kings. He
was far advanced in years at the time when the events
related here took place. He had such a fine warship
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page47" id="page47"></a>[pg 47]</span>
that for strength and excellence of every kind it had
no equal in all the countries of the North. It was
riding at anchor in the harbour, but King Halfdan
had gone ashore to give orders for a carousal before
starting on his voyage. And when Sörli saw the
warship his heart was consumed with a burning
desire to possess it at all possible hazards. And indeed
it is generally agreed that there never was a
greater treasure of a warship than this in all the
countries of the North, except the warships Ellithi
and Gnöth and the Long Serpent.</p>

<p>So he ordered his men to prepare themselves for
battle&mdash;</p>

<p>"For we must slay King Halfdan and seize his
warship."</p>

<p>A man called Sævar, his fo'c'sle-man and marshal,
made answer:</p>

<p>"That is not advisable, Sire, for Halfdan is a great
chief and a famous man. Moreover he has two sons
who will be certain to avenge him, for they are both
very famous men already."</p>

<p>"Though they be superior to the very gods," said
Sörli, "yet we shall fight just as we have done before."</p>

<p>They prepared for battle, and the news reached
King Halfdan. He started up and went with all his
men to his ships, and they prepared them for battle
at once. Some of Halfdan's men protested to him
that it was not advisable to fight, and suggested that
he should take to flight as the odds were too heavy
against them. The King replied that they would all
fall dead one on the top of another before he would
flee.</p>

<p>Both sides now prepared to give battle, and closed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page48" id="page48"></a>[pg 48]</span>
forthwith in a fierce combat, the result of which was
that King Halfdan fell with all his host; and Sörli
took possession of the warship and everything on it
that was of value.</p>

<p>Then Sörli learned that Högni had returned from
a raiding expedition and was lying off Odinsø.
Sörli set off thither with his ships, and when they
met, he told him of the death of Halfdan, his father,
and made him an offer of reconciliation on his own
terms, suggesting also that they should become
foster-brothers; but Högni declined all his offers.
Then they joined battle, as is told in the poem dealing
with Sörli. Haakon fought very boldly and slew
Sævar, Sörli's standard-bearer and fo'c'sle-man. Then
Sörli slew Haakon, but Högni slew King Erling,
Sörli's father. After that Högni and Sörli fought
together, and Sörli went down before Högni from
weariness and wounds. And Högni afterwards
caused him to be healed of his wounds, and they
swore foster-brotherhood to one another, and both
remained true to their oaths as long as they lived.
Sörli was the first to die. He fell in the Baltic at the
hands of vikings, as is told in the poem of which he
is the subject.</p>

<p>And when Högni heard of Sörli's death, he went
raiding in the Baltic the same summer, and was
victorious everywhere. He became king over those
regions; and it is said that twenty kings were vassals
to King Högni and paid him tribute. Högni became
so famous on account of his great deeds and his
raiding expeditions that his name was as well known
in the north of Finland as away in Paris, and everywhere
in between.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page49" id="page49"></a>[pg 49]</span>

<a name="s5" id="s5"></a>
<p class="indent">V.<a href="#ns5">°</a> &nbsp;There was a King called Hjarrandi who ruled
over Serkland. He had a wife and a son called
Hethin, who quickly grew into a man remarkable
for his strength, stature and ability. While still a
youth he went on raiding expeditions and became a
sea-king, harrying all round Spain and Greece and
all the neighbouring kingdoms; so that he made
twenty kings pay him tribute, holding their land and
revenue as his vassals. In winter time Hethin used
to stay at home in Serkland. It is said that on one
occasion he went into a forest with his retinue. He
left his men and found himself alone in a glade where
he saw a woman, tall and fair, sitting on a throne.
She spoke to him courteously, and when he asked her
her name she said she was called Göndul. Then they
talked together. She questioned him about his
mighty deeds and he told her everything frankly
and asked her whether she knew of any king to
match himself in valour and hardihood, renown and
prowess. She replied that she knew of one who did
not fall short of him&mdash;one who had twenty kings
subject to him just as Hethin had; and she added
that his name was Högni and that he lived in the
North, in Denmark.</p>

<p>"I know one thing," said Hethin; "we have got
to prove which of us is the more valiant."</p>

<p>"It is high time for you to return to your men,"
said she; "they will be looking for you."</p>

<p>Then they parted. He returned to his men, and
she remained sitting there.</p>

<p>At the very beginning of spring, Hethin prepared
to set out. He had a warship, and three hundred and
sixty men in it, and he made for the northern part
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page50" id="page50"></a>[pg 50]</span>
of the world. He sailed all that summer and the
following winter, and at the beginning of spring he
reached Denmark.</p>

<a name="s6" id="s6"></a>
<p class="indent">VI.<a href="#ns6">°</a> &nbsp;King Högni was at home at that time; and
when he heard that a famous king had come to his
shores, he invited him to a magnificent banquet, and
Hethin accepted the invitation. And as they sat
drinking, Högni asked what motive brought Hethin
so far north.</p>

<p>Hethin replied that his object was to compete with
him in contests which would make trial of their
courage and daring and all their prowess and skill.</p>

<p>Högni said he was ready for this; and early next
morning they went swimming and shooting together.
They rode a-tilt, and performed feats of arms and of
skill of all kinds. And in all their exploits they were
so equal that no-one could distinguish which was the
better of the two. After that they swore foster-brotherhood
to one another, and bound themselves to share
everything equally.</p>

<p>Hethin was young and unmarried, but Högni
was somewhat older. He had married Hervör, the
daughter of Hjörvarth, the son of Heithrek Ulfham.
Högni had a daughter who was called Hild, and who
excelled all other women in beauty and understanding.
He loved his daughter exceedingly. He
had no other children.</p>

<a name="s7" id="s7"></a>
<p class="indent">VII.<a href="#ns7">°</a> &nbsp;It is said that a little later Högni went
on a raiding expedition while Hethin stayed behind
to look after his kingdom. It chanced one day that
Hethin went into a forest to pass the time. The
weather was mild. He again wandered away from
his men. He came upon a forest glade, and there he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page51" id="page51"></a>[pg 51]</span>
saw sitting on a throne the same woman whom he had
seen before in Serkland&mdash;only now he thought her
even fairer than before. She was again the first to speak
and chattered to him gaily. She was holding a horn
with a lid to it. The King fell in love with her. She
offered him a drink and he felt thirsty, as he had
grown warm; so he took the horn and drank; and
when he had drunk, a very wonderful change came
over him, for he remembered nothing that had
happened to him previously. He then sat down and
talked to her.</p>

<p>She asked him if what she had said to him before
of the skill and courage of Högni had proved true
and Hethin replied that it was true enough&mdash;"for
he did not come short of me in any feat that we tried,
and so we declared ourselves a match."</p>

<p>"Yet you two are not equal," said she.</p>

<p>"And why not?" asked Hethin.</p>

<p>"For this reason," replied she: "Högni has
married a wife of high birth, whereas you have no
wife."</p>

<p>He replied: "Högni will marry me to Hild his
daughter as soon as I like to ask him, and then I shall
be as well married as he."</p>

<p>"Your honour will be impaired," said she, "if
you ask Högni for a marriage alliance. If, as you
profess, you lack neither courage nor valour, you
would do better to carry off Hild by force, and put
the Queen to death by taking her and laying her down
in front of the prow of your warship, and letting it
cut her in two when it is launched."</p>

<p>The wickedness and forgetfulness contained in the
ale which Hethin had drunk had so got the better of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page52" id="page52"></a>[pg 52]</span>
him that there seemed to him to be no alternative,
and he had not the slightest recollection that he and
Högni were 'foster-brothers.'</p>

<p>Presently they parted, and Hethin went back to
his men. This took place in the late summer.</p>

<p>Then Hethin ordered his men to get ready the
warship, saying that he intended to go home to
Serkland. Then he went into the ladies' bower and
took the Queen and Hild by either hand and led
them out. Hild's clothes and jewels were also taken.
There was no-one in the kingdom who had the
courage to do anything; for they were afraid of
Hethin and his men&mdash;he glowered so fiercely.</p>

<p>Hild asked Hethin what his intention was, and he
told her. She besought him to think better of it,
adding:</p>

<p>"My father will marry me to you if you ask him
for me."</p>

<p>"Ask for you?" echoed Hethin; "I will never
do that."</p>

<p>"And," she continued, "if you really must carry
me off, even so my father will make it up with you.
But if you do anything so wicked and unmanly as
to put my mother to death, my father will never
make it up with you. I have had a warning in dreams
that you two will fight and slay one another. Yet
I am afraid that there must be something still more
terrible in store. It will be a great sorrow to me if
I have to be the means of exposing my father to
the ruinous effects of magic spells; nor shall I have
any joy in seeing you in difficulties and toils."</p>

<p>Hethin replied that he cared not at all for the consequences,
and that he would do as he had threatened.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page53" id="page53"></a>[pg 53]</span>

<p>"You cannot mend it now," said Hild, "because
in this case you are not your own master."</p>

<p>Then Hethin went down to the sea-shore, and
now was the warship launched. He thrust the Queen
down in front of the prow, so that she perished.
Hethin stepped into the warship. And when it was
quite ready, he took it into his head to land alone,
leaving his men behind; and he went into the same
forest where he had gone before. And when he
came into the glade, there he saw Göndul seated on
her throne. They greeted one another cordially.
Hethin told her what he had done and she expressed
her approval.</p>

<p>She had with her the horn which she had carried
before, and she offered him a drink from it. He took
it and drank; and when he had drunk, sleep fell upon
him, and he let his head sink into her lap. And when
he had fallen asleep, she slipped away from under
his head, saying:</p>

<p>"Now I devote both you and Högni and all your
followers, and lay you under all the spells imposed
by Othin."</p>

<p>Then Hethin awoke and saw the fleeting shadow
of Göndul, but she appeared to him now to be big
and black; and he recalled everything and realised
how much mischief he had done. He decided now
to go away somewhere a long way off, where he
would not each day have his wicked deeds cast in
his teeth. So he went to his ship, and made haste
to free her from her moorings. A fair breeze was
blowing off the land, and so he sailed away with Hild.</p>

<a name="s8" id="s8"></a>
<p class="indent">VIII.<a href="#ns8">°</a> &nbsp;When Högni returned home, he learnt that
Hethin had sailed away with Hild and the warship
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page54" id="page54"></a>[pg 54]</span>
Halfdanarnaut, leaving the dead body of the Queen
in his tracks. Högni was furious and bade his
men start up on the spot and sail in pursuit of
Hethin. This they did, and a fair breeze sprang up.
Every evening they reached the harbour from which
Hethin had sailed away in the morning.</p>

<p>It happened one day that as Högni was making
for a harbour, Hethin's sails were sighted out at sea;
so Högni and his men gave chase. As a matter of
fact, it is said that at this point Hethin got a head wind
against him, whereas Högni had the luck to have a
fair wind as before. Hethin then lay to off an island
called Hoy, and there he rode at anchor. Högni
quickly came alongside, and when they met, Hethin
greeted him courteously.</p>

<p>"I must tell you, foster-brother," said Hethin,
"that so great a misfortune has come upon me that
no-one save you can remedy it. I have carried off
your daughter and your warship, and put your wife
to death, yet from no personal wickedness of my
own, but rather from promptings of evil spirits and
wicked spells. My wish now is that you shall have
your own way entirely in this matter between yourself
and me. I also offer to give up to you both Hild and
the warship, and all the men and money contained
in it, and to go to such distant lands that I can never
return to the North nor into your sight as long as I
live."</p>

<p>Högni replied: "Had you asked me for Hild
I would have married her to you; and even in spite
of your having carried her off by force we might have
made up our quarrel. Now, however, since you have
been guilty of such an outrage as to put the Queen to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page55" id="page55"></a>[pg 55]</span>
death in a most shameful manner, I certainly will not
make terms with you. We will try here, on the spot,
which of us is the more valiant fighter."</p>

<p>Hethin replied: "It would be best, if nothing less
than fighting will satisfy you, that we two should measure
our strength alone; for you have no quarrel with
any man here save with me. There is no use in making
innocent men pay for my crimes and evil deeds."</p>

<p>Their followers all swore with one accord that
they would rather fall dead in heaps than that they
two should exchange blows alone. And when Hethin
saw that nothing would satisfy Högni, save that they
should fight, he ordered his men to land, saying:</p>

<p>"I will no longer hold back from Högni, nor make
excuses to avoid fighting. Let every man bear
himself bravely!"</p>

<p>They thereupon landed and fell to fighting.
Högni was full of fury, but Hethin was both dexterous
with his weapons and mighty in his stroke.
It is told for fact that so potent was the evil charm
in the spell that even when they had cloven one
another to the very shoulders, yet they started up as
before and went on fighting. Hild sat in a grove and
watched the battle.</p>

<p>This harrowing torment continued to oppress
them from the time when they began to fight until
Olaf Tryggvason became King of Norway. It is
said to have gone on for a hundred and forty-three
years, until it fell to the lot of this famous man that
one of his retinue released them from their grievous
calamities and tragic doom.</p>

<a name="s9" id="s9"></a>
<p class="indent">IX.<a href="#ns9">°</a> &nbsp;In the first year of King Olaf's reign, it is
said that he came one evening to the island of Hoy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page56" id="page56"></a>[pg 56]</span>
and anchored there. It was a regular occurrence in
the neighbourhood of this island that watchmen
disappeared every night, and no-one knew what had
become of them. On this particular night it was Ivar
the Gleam who kept guard. And when all the men
on the ships were asleep, Ivar took the sword that
Jarnskjöld had had and that Thorstein his son had
given him, and all his armour, and went up on to the
island. And when he had landed on the island he
saw a man coming towards him. He was very tall
and covered with blood, and his face was full of
sorrow. Ivar asked him his name, and he replied that
he was called Hethin, the son of Hjarrandi, and that
he had come of a stock in far Serkland, adding:</p>

<p>"I am telling you the truth when I say that the
vanishing of the watchmen must be laid to the charge
of me and Högni, the son of Halfdan. For we and
our men have been laid under such powerful and
destructive spells that we go on fighting night and
day; and this has continued for many generations,
while Hild, the daughter of Högni, sits and looks on.
It is Othin who has laid this spell upon us; and our
only hope of redemption is that a Christian man should
give battle to us.&mdash;When that occurs, he whom the
Christian slays shall not stand up again; and so will
each one be freed from his distress. Now I would
pray you that you will come to fight with us, because
I know that you are a good Christian, and also that
the King whom you serve is very lucky. I have a
feeling too that we shall get some good from him and
his men."</p>

<p>Ivar agreed to go with him.</p>

<p>Hethin was glad at that and said:</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page57" id="page57"></a>[pg 57]</span>

<p>"You must take care not to encounter Högni face
to face, and also not to slay me before you slay
him; because no mortal man can encounter Högni
face to face and slay him if I die before him,
for the glance of his eye strikes terror and spares
none. Therefore this is the only way: I will attack
him in front and engage him in battle, while you go
behind and give him his death stroke. You will
find it an easy matter to slay me, when I am left
alive last of all."</p>

<p>Then they went into the battle, and Ivar saw that
all that Hethin had told him was quite true. He
went behind Högni and struck him on the head,
and clove his skull down to the shoulders, whereupon
Högni fell down dead and never rose up again. After
that he slew all the men who were fighting, and last
of all he slew Hethin, which was no great task.</p>

<p>When he returned to the ships the day was
dawning. He went to the King and told him what
he had done. The King was very well pleased with
his work and told him that he had had great good
luck. Next day they landed and made their way to the
spot where the battle had taken place; but they saw
no sign of what had happened there. Yet the bloodstains
on Ivar's sword were visible proofs; and never
again did watchmen disappear on that coast.</p>

<p>After that the King went home to his realm.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page58" id="page58"></a>[pg 58]</span>

<h3 style="margin-top: 3em;">INTRODUCTION TO THE SAGA OF HROMUND GREIPSSON</h3>

<p>In the <i>Saga of Thorgils and Haflithi</i>, ch. 10
(published in <i>Sturlunga Saga</i>, ed. by G. Vigfusson,
Vol. <span class="sc">i</span>, p. 19), we are told that at a wedding held at
Reykjaholar in Iceland in 1119, "There was fun
and merriment and great festivity and all kinds of
amusements, such as dancing and wrestling and
story-telling.... Although it is a matter of no great
importance, some record has been preserved of
the entertainment which was provided, and who were
the people who provided it. Stories were told which
many people now reject, and of which they disclaim
any knowledge; for it seems that many people do not
know what is true, but think some things to be true
which are really pure invention and other things to
be fictitious which are really true. Hralf of Skalmarnes
told a story about Hröngvith the Viking and
Olaf 'the Sailors' King,' and about the rifling of the
barrow of Thrain the berserk, and about Hromund
Gripsson, and included many verses in his story.
King Sverrir used to be entertained with this story
and declared that fictitious stories like this were the
most entertaining of any. Yet there are men who
can trace their ancestry to Hromund Gripsson.
Hrolf himself had composed this story."</p>

<p>Among those whose ancestry was traced to
Hromund Greipsson were Ingolf and Leif, the
first Norwegian colonists of Iceland. According to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page59" id="page59"></a>[pg 59]</span>
<i>Landnámabók</i>, 1, ch. 3, they were second cousins,
and their grandfathers, who had come from Thelamörk
in the south-west of Norway, were sons of
Hromund. Olaf 'The Sailors' King' is mentioned
also in the <i>Saga of Grím Lothinkinni</i>, ch. 3; and
members of his family figure prominently in several
other sagas.</p>

<p>These persons may actually be historical. But
the fictitious element is obvious enough in many
places as, for instance, in Hromund's voyage to the
west. Thrain himself is vividly presented to us as
"black and huge, with talons like bird's claws, all
clad in glittering gold, seated on a throne, roaring
loudly and blowing a fire!" This chapter is indeed
a tale of</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Ghaisties and ghoulies,</p>
<p>And lang-leggity beasties,</p>
<p>And things that gae bump in the nicht.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>The most curious features of the saga, however,
are the blurred and perhaps confused reminiscences
of stories and characters which form the
subject of some of the Edda poems. The brothers
Bild and Voli can hardly be other than corruptions
of the god Balder and his avenger Váli. The name
of Hromund's sword 'Mistletoe' too may be a
reminiscence of the same story, though a sword of
the same name is found in <i>Hervarar Saga</i> (ch. 2).
Again, the account of Hromund's sojourn with
Hagal, disguised as a grinding-maid, and the search
made by Blind (ch. 8) are certainly reminiscences of
the Edda poem <i>Helgakvitha Hundingsbana II</i> (sometimes
called <i>Völsungakvitha</i>), where the same adventures
are recorded in connection with the same
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page60" id="page60"></a>[pg 60]</span>
names, except that Helgi here takes the place
Hromund.</p>

<p>But the most interesting case, however, is the story
of Hromund's opponent Helgi the Bold and Kara
(ch. 7). In this story, Helgi is said to be in the service
of two kings called Hadding, and there can be little
doubt that Helgi and Kara are identical with Helgi
Haddingjaskati and Kara, whose adventures formed
the subject of a lost poem called <i>Káruljóth</i>. This
poem is referred to in the prose at the end of <i>Helgakvitha
Hundingsbana II</i>, where it is stated that they
were reincarnations of Helgi Hundingsbani and
Sigrún&mdash;just as the two latter were themselves reincarnations
of Helgi the son of Hjörvarth and
Sváva&mdash;"but that is now said to be an old wives'
tale."</p>

<p>Chapter 4 also has a special interest of its own.
Breaking into barrows was a favourite exploit of
the Norsemen, no doubt for the sake of the gold
which they often contained. References to the
practice are very common in the sagas, e.g. <i>Grettissaga</i>,
ch. 18; <i>Hartharsaga</i>, ch. 15; cf. also Saxo Grammaticus,
<i>Dan. Hist.</i>, p. 200 ff., etc. The ruthlessness
with which the Norsemen plundered the Irish
barrows is mentioned with great indignation in the
Irish Chronicles. In the <i>War of the Gaedhil with
the Gaill</i>, cap. <span class="sc">xxv</span>, we read that certain Norsemen
plundered in Ireland "until they reached
Kerry, and they left not a cave there under ground
that they did not explore." In the same work
cap. LXIX, we are told that&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
Never was there a fortress, or a fastness, or a mound, or a
church, or a sacred place, or a sanctuary, when it was taken
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page61" id="page61"></a>[pg 61]</span>
by that howling, furious, loathsome crew, which was not
plundered by the collectors and accumulators of that wealth.
Neither was there in concealment under ground in Erin,
nor the various solitudes belonging to Fians or to Fairies,
anything that was not discovered by these foreign, wonderful
Denmarkians, through paganism and idol worship.
</p></blockquote>

<p>Finally in the <i>Annals of Ulster</i> we read (sub anno
862) that</p>

<blockquote><p>
The cave of Achadh-Aldai (i.e. probably New Grange,
near Dublin) and [the cave] of Knowth, and the cave of Fert-Boadan
over Dowth, and the cave of the smith's wife were
searched by the foreigners (i.e. Norsemen, etc.) which had
not been done before.
</p></blockquote>

<p>And in England as late as 1344 Thomas of Walsingham
records the slaying of the dragon that guarded
a barrow, and the recovery of a great treasure of gold
by the retainers of the Earl of Warrenne.</p>

<p>Popular imagination believed that barrows were
occupied by a ghostly inhabitant 'haugbui,' who
guarded the treasure. This was sometimes a dragon,
as in <i>Beowulf</i>, or a reanimated corpse, as in our saga;
but whatever he was, he inspired the outside world
with such fear that the breaking into a grave-mound
came to be regarded as a deed of the greatest courage
and prowess. The 'hogboy' (<i>haugbui</i>) of Maeshowe,
a barrow in the Orkneys, is still a living reality in
the imaginations of the country people<a id="footnotetagiii1" name="footnotetagiii1"></a><a href="#footnoteiii1"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately <i>The Saga of Hromund Greipsson</i> is
preserved only in late paper <span class="sc">mss</span>., of which none
apparently are earlier than the seventeenth century.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page62" id="page62"></a>[pg 62]</span>
None of the verses of which the notice in the <i>Saga
of Thorgils and Haflithi</i> speaks (cf. p. 58 above) have
been preserved. There is, however, a rhymed version
of the saga known as <i>Gríplur</i>, dating apparently from
about the year 1400 and evidently taken from a
better text than any of those which have come down
to us. A short extract from these rhymed verses will
be found on pp. 173-75. For a full discussion of the
relationship of the <i>Gríplur</i> to the extant texts of the
saga and to the later ballads, the reader is referred to
Kölbing, <i>Beiträge zur Vergleichenden Geschichte der
Romantischen Poesie und Prosa des Mittelalters</i> (Breslau,
1876), pp. 181-83, and to Andrews, <i>Studies in the

literature relating to this saga will be found in

<h3 style="margin-top: 3em;">THE SAGA OF HROMUND GREIPSSON<a href="#nhg1">°</a></h3>

<p class="indent">I. &nbsp;There was a King called Olaf, the son of
Gnothar-Asmund, and he ruled over Garthar in
Denmark, and was very famous. Two brothers, Kari
and Örnulf, both mighty warriors, were entrusted
with the defence of his territories. In that district
there was a wealthy landowner called Greip, who
had a wife called Gunnlöth, the daughter of Hrok
the Black. They had nine sons whose names were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page63" id="page63"></a>[pg 63]</span>
as follows: Hrolf, Haki, Gaut, Thröst, Angantyr,
Logi, Hromund, Helgi, Hrok. They were all
promising fellows, though Hromund was the finest of
them. He did not know what fear was. He was blue-eyed
and fair-haired; he was broad-shouldered, tall
and strong, and resembled his mother's father. The
King had two men called Bild and Voli. They were
wicked and deceitful, but the King valued them highly.</p>

<p>On one occasion King Olaf was sailing eastwards
with his fleet along the coast of Norway. They put
in at Ulfasker, and lying to off one of the islands they
began to plunder. The King bade Kari and Örnulf
go up on the island and look if they could see any
warships. They went up on land and saw six warships
under some cliffs, one of them being a most
gorgeous 'Dragon.' Kari called to the men and
asked whose ships they were. One of the scoundrels
on the 'Dragon' stood up and declared his name to
be Hröngvith, adding:</p>

<p>"But what may your name be?"</p>

<p>Kari told him his own name and the name of his
brother and added:</p>

<p>"You are the worst man I know and I am going
to chop you into fragments."</p>

<p>Hröngvith replied: "For thirty-three years I have
harried both summer and winter. I have fought
sixty battles and been victorious every time with my
sword Brynthvari, which has never grown blunt.
Come here to-morrow, Kari, and I will sheathe it in
your breast."</p>

<p>Kari said he would not fail to appear.</p>

<p>Hröngvith had it in his power to choose every day
who was to perish by the point of his sword.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page64" id="page64"></a>[pg 64]</span>

<a name="hg2" id="hg2"></a>
<p class="indent">II.<a href="#nhg2">°</a> &nbsp;The brothers went back to the King and told
him the news. The King gave orders to prepare for
battle, and his men set to work. The hosts met
and a stiff fight took place. The brothers fought
bravely, Kari slaying eight or twelve men with every
blow. When Hröngvith saw that, he leapt up on the
King's ship, attacked Kari and thrust him through
with his sword. As soon as Kari was wounded he
called to the King:</p>

<p>"Farewell, Sire. I am going to be Othin's guest!"</p>

<p>Hröngvith spitted Örnulf on his spear, and when
both the brothers had fallen, Hröngvith called out
to the rest to surrender. Then a murmur of discontent
arose in the King's host. No blade would
wound Hröngvith. Now it is told that Hromund
Greipsson was in the King's retinue. He took a club
in his hand, fastened a long grey goat's beard on his
face, drew a hood over his head, and then rushed to
the fight, where he found the two brothers lying dead.
He rescued the King's standard, and began to deal
death among the scoundrels with his club.</p>

<p>Hröngvith asked who he was and if he were the
father of that wretched Kari.</p>

<p>Hromund told him his name and said he was
going to avenge the brothers:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Though Kari was no relative of mine, I will slay
you all the same."</p>

<p>And thereupon he dealt Hröngvith such a blow
with his club that his head was all awry afterwards.</p>

<p>Hröngvith said: "I have been in many battles,
but I never got such a blow!"</p>

<p>Hromund struck another blow at Hröngvith and
broke his skull. At the third stroke he died. After
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page65" id="page65"></a>[pg 65]</span>
that all the survivors surrendered to the King, and so
the battle ended.</p>

<a name="hg3" id="hg3"></a>
<p class="indent">III.<a href="#nhg3">°</a> &nbsp;Then Hromund proceeded to ransack the
ship, and came upon a man prepared to offer resistance
in the prow. He asked the man's name; and
he replied that he was called Helgi the Bold, a
brother of Hröngvith, and added: "I have no mind
to sue for peace." Hromund gave orders that the
wounds of Helgi the Bold should be attended to.
Then he sailed away to Sweden and was entrusted
with the defence of part of the country.</p>

<p>After that King Olaf sailed away to the British
Isles with his host, as far as the Hebrides, where they
landed and made a raid. There was a man dwelling
hard by whose cattle had been taken and driven
away by the King's men, and he was bewailing his
loss piteously. Hromund went and asked him who
he was.</p>

<p>The man replied that his name was Mani and that
his home was a very little way off; and he said that
they would win more honour by breaking into
barrows and plundering the treasures of ghosts.</p>

<p>Hromund asked him to tell him if he knew anything
about places of this kind.</p>

<p>Mani replied that he certainly did:&mdash;</p>

<p>"There was a berserk called Thrain, a big, strong
man who was deeply versed in sorcery. He conquered
Valland and was King there. He was put into a
barrow with a sword, armour and great treasure;
but no-one is in a hurry to go there."</p>

<p>Hromund asked in which direction they should
sail in order to reach it, and he replied that they
could reach it by sailing due south for six days.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page66" id="page66"></a>[pg 66]</span>
Hromund thanked the man for his information, gave
him money, and restored his cattle to him. Then
they sailed away in the direction indicated by the man,
and at the end of six days they saw the barrow straight
in front of their ship.</p>

<a name="hg4" id="hg4"></a>
<p class="indent">IV.<a href="#nhg4">°</a> &nbsp;They went from the British Isles to Valland,
and found the barrow and immediately set to work
to break it open. And when six days had elapsed
they came upon a trap-door in the barrow. There
they beheld a big fiend, black and huge, all clad in
glittering gold, and seated on a throne. He was
roaring loudly and blowing a fire.</p>

<p>Hromund asked: "Now who will enter the barrow?
Whoever does so shall have his choice of three
treasures."</p>

<p>Voli replied: "No-one will be anxious to forfeit
his life for them. There are sixty men here, and that
troll will be the death of them all."</p>

<p>Hromund said: "Kari would have ventured on it,
had he been alive," and he added&mdash;what was true
enough&mdash;that even if he were let down by a rope,
it would not be so bad to struggle against eight others
as against Thrain.</p>

<p>Then Hromund climbed down by a rope.&mdash;It was
during the night; and when he had got down, he
gathered up a great amount of treasure and bound
it to the end of the rope.</p>

<p>Thrain had been King of Valland in bygone days
and had won all his victories by magic. He had
wrought great evil; and when he was so old that he
could fight no longer, he had got himself shut up
alive in the barrow, and much treasure along with
him.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page67" id="page67"></a>[pg 67]</span>

<p>Now Hromund saw a sword hanging up on a
pillar. He took it down, girded it on, and marched
up to the throne, saying:</p>

<p>"It is time for me to leave the barrow since there
is no-one to stop me. But what ails you, old fellow?
Have you not seen me gathering up your money
while you sit quietly by, you hateful cur? Were you
not ashamed to look on while I took your sword
and necklace and ever so many more of your treasures?"</p>

<p>Thrain said that he cared for nothing if only he
would let him sit quietly on his throne: "Formerly,"
he continued, "I used to be the first to fight. I must
have become a great coward if I let you rob me of
my wealth single handed; but I'm going to prevent
your taking my treasures; you had better beware of
me, dead though I am."</p>

<p>Then said Hromund: "Hoist yourself up on your
legs, coward and weakling, and take back your sword
from me if you dare."</p>

<p>The ghost replied: "There is no glory in attacking
me with a sword when I am unarmed. I would rather
try my strength in wrestling with you."</p>

<p>Then Hromund flung down the sword and trusted
to his strength. When Thrain saw that, he took down
his cauldron which he kept above him. He was by no
means pleasant to watch as he blew up his fire, ready
to make a meal from the cauldron. The body of the
cauldron was full, and there was a big flame beneath
its feet. Thrain was wearing a gold-wrought mantle.
Both his hands were crooked and his finger nails
were like talons.</p>

<p>Hromund said: "Get down off your throne, vile
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page68" id="page68"></a>[pg 68]</span>
wretch, now that you have been robbed of all
wealth."</p>

<p>Then said the ghost: "To be sure, it is high time
to get on my legs, since you taunt me with lack of
courage."</p>

<p>Day departed, and evening drew on, and it became
dark in the barrow. Then the ghost began wrestling
with Hromund and threw down his cauldron.
Hromund put forth all his strength, and they fought
so hard that rubble and stones were torn up. Then the
ghost sank down on one knee, saying:</p>

<p>"You press me hard: you are indeed a brave
fellow."</p>

<p>Hromund replied: "Stand up on your feet again
without support. You are much weaker than Mani
the peasant said."</p>

<p>Then Thrain turned himself into a troll, and the
barrow was filled with a horrible stench: and he
stuck his claws into the back of Hromund's neck,
tearing the flesh from his bones down to his loins,
saying:</p>

<p>"You need not complain if the game is rough
and your body sore, for I am going to tear you limb
from limb."</p>

<p>"I cannot imagine," cried Hromund, "how such
a cat has got into this barrow!"</p>

<p>The ghost replied: "You must have been brought
up by Gunnlöth. There are not many like you."</p>

<p>"It will go ill with you," said Hromund, "if you
go on scratching me long."</p>

<p>They wrestled hard and long till everything round
them shook. At last Hromund tripped him and brought
him down. It had become very dark by this time.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page69" id="page69"></a>[pg 69]</span>

<p>Then said the ghost: "By guile you have overcome
me and taken my sword. It was that that brought
our struggle to this issue. I have lived in my barrow
for a long time, brooding over my riches; but it is
not wise to trust too much to one's treasures, however
good they may seem. Never would I have
thought that you, Mistletoe, my good sword, would
do me a hurt."</p>

<p>Hromund then freed himself and seized the sword,
and said:</p>

<p>"Now tell me how many men you have slain
in single combat with Mistletoe."</p>

<p>"A hundred and forty four," said the ghost, "and
I never got a scratch. I tried my skill with King
Seming who was in Sweden, and he was of the
opinion that it would take a long time to vanquish
me."</p>

<p>Hromund said: "You have been a curse on men
for a long time, and it will be a good deed to kill
you at once."</p>

<p>Then he cut off the ghost's head, and burned him
to ashes on the fire; and then he went out of the
barrow. They asked him on what terms he and
Thrain had parted, and he replied that matters had
gone according to his wishes:&mdash;"For I cut off his
head."</p>

<p>Hromund kept for himself the three treasures
which he had won in the barrow&mdash;the ring, the
necklace and Mistletoe; but everyone received a
share of the money.</p>

<p>Then King Olaf sailed away to his kingdom in the
north, and settled down peacefully in his own country.</p>

<a name="hg5" id="hg5"></a>
<p class="indent">V.<a href="#nhg5">°</a> &nbsp;After that Hromund grew very famous. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page70" id="page70"></a>[pg 70]</span>
was generous and popular. One day he gave to a
man called Hrok a ring of solid gold which weighed
an ounce. Voli got to know about that and slew
Hrok by night and stole the ring. And when the
King heard of it he said he would be even with Voli
some day for such a piece of villainy.</p>

<p>The King had two sisters, one called Dagny and
the other Svanhvit. Svanhvit was better than her
sister in every way, and had no equal between Sweden
and Halogaland.</p>

<p>Hromund Greipsson was at home at this time and
became friendly with Svanhvit; but he took no precautions
against either Voli or Bild. On one occasion
she told Hromund that Voli and Bild were busy
slandering him to the King.</p>

<p>He said: "I am not afraid of any low wretch, and
I shall talk to you as long as you give me the chance."</p>

<p>This slander became so serious that Hromund
and his brother had to leave the King's retinue and
go home to their father.</p>

<p>A short time after, Svanhvit was talking to King
Olaf and said:</p>

<p>"Hromund, who brought us the greatest glory,
has now been banished from the royal retinue; and
in his place you retain two men who care for neither
honour nor virtue."</p>

<p>The King replied: "A rumour reached me that
he intended to betray you; and the sword shall part
your love."</p>

<p>"You have very soon forgotten," said she, "the time
when he went alone into the barrow; and no-one else
dared.&mdash;Voli and Bild will be hanged first."</p>

<p>And having said this, she departed hastily.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page71" id="page71"></a>[pg 71]</span>

<a name="hg6" id="hg6"></a>
<p class="indent">VI.<a href="#nhg6">°</a> &nbsp;Some time after this, two kings, both called
Hadding, came from Sweden, and Helgi the
brother of Hröngvith was with them. They challenged
King Olaf to battle with them on the frozen
surface of Lake Vener in the western part of the land.
He preferred fighting them to abandoning his
country, so he summoned Hromund and his brothers
to follow him. Hromund, however, declined to go,
saying that Bild and Voli were mighty fine fellows
and always fought for the King.</p>

<p>The King departed with his host. Svanhvit was
grieved at what had happened, and went to Hromund's
home. Hromund welcomed her.</p>

<p>"Hearken now to my prayer," said she, "more
favourably than you did to my brother's request,
and help the King. I will give you a shield with a
strap attached. Nothing can harm you while you
wear this strap."</p>

<p>Hromund thanked her for the gift and she was
comforted; so he and his eight brothers made ready
to set out.</p>

<p>In the meantime the King and his host reached the
frozen Vener, where the Swedish army was waiting
for them. And in the morning, as soon as it was light
enough to fight, they armed themselves on the ice,
and the Swedes made a fierce onslaught. Bild was
slain as soon as the battle began, but Voli was nowhere
to be seen. King Olaf and King Hadding
were wounded.</p>

<p>Hromund had pitched his tent near the side of
the lake. His brothers armed themselves early in
the morning; but Hromund said:</p>

<p>"I had a bad dream in the night; some misfortune
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page72" id="page72"></a>[pg 72]</span>
is in store for us, and I am not going into the battle
today."</p>

<p>His brothers replied that it was disgraceful not
to have the courage to support the King's army, when
he had come for that very purpose.</p>

<p>They went into the battle and fought bravely
and all those of the army of the Haddings who came
against them fell in heaps. A witch had come among
them in the likeness of a swan. She sang and worked
such powerful spells that none of Olaf's men took
heed to defend themselves. Then she flew over the
sons of Greip, singing loudly. Her name was Kara.
At that same moment Helgi the Bold encountered
the eight brothers and slew every one of them.</p>

<p class="indent">VII. &nbsp;At this point Hromund entered the battle.
Helgi the Bold caught sight of him and cried:</p>

<p>"Here comes the man who slew my brother
Hröngvith. Now you must beware of that sword of
his which he got in the barrow.&mdash;You held aloof
while I slew your brothers."</p>

<p>"You need not question my courage, Helgi,"
replied Hromund, "for one or other of us must fall
now."</p>

<p>Helgi said: "Mistletoe is such a heavy weapon
that you cannot use it. I will lend you another that
you can manage."</p>

<p>"You need not taunt me with faint-heartedness,"
cried Hromund. "Remember the blow which
I dealt Hröngvith, when I shattered his skull to
atoms!"</p>

<p>Helgi said: "You have bound a girl's garter round
your hand, Hromund. Lay aside the shield which
you are carrying. It will be impossible to wound you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page73" id="page73"></a>[pg 73]</span>
so long as you carry that: I am sure that you are
dependent on that girl."</p>

<p>Hromund could not endure these galling words,
and flung down his shield. Helgi the Bold had
always been victorious, and it was by means of magic
that he had gained his success. His mistress' name
was Kara&mdash;she who was present in the form of a
swan. Helgi brandished his sword so high over his
head that it chopped off the swan's leg. He drove the
sword down into the ground as far as the hilt, and said:</p>

<p>"My luck has fled now; and it was a bad business
when I missed you."</p>

<p>Hromund replied: "You were very unlucky,
Helgi, to be the slayer of your own mistress, and you
will have no more happiness."</p>

<p>Kara dropped down dead. And with the stroke
that Helgi made at Hromund, when the sword was
buried up to the hilt, the point of the sword caught
Hromund's belly and ripped it open, and Helgi
fell forward with the force of his own stroke. Hromund
was not behindhand then: he struck Helgi on
the head with Mistletoe, cleaving helmet and skull
down to the shoulders, and breaking a piece out of
the sword. Then Hromund took his belt-knife and
thrust it into his belly where there was a gaping
wound, and forced back the paunch fat which was
hanging out. At the same time he stitched up the
edges of his belly with a cord, bound his clothes
firmly over it, and so continued fighting valiantly.
Men fell dead in heaps before him, and he fought
on till midnight. Then the survivors of the army of
the Haddings fled, and thereupon the battle came to
an end.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page74" id="page74"></a>[pg 74]</span>

<p>Then Hromund saw a man standing before him
on the ice, and he felt convinced that he must have
made the ice on the lake by spells. He perceived
that it was Voli. He remarked that it was not unfitting
that he should give him his deserts, and
rushed at him, brandishing Mistletoe and intending
to strike him. Voli blew the sword out of his hand,
and it happened to light on a hole in the ice, and
sank to the bottom.</p>

<p>Then Voli laughed and said: "You are doomed
now that you have lost hold of Mistletoe."</p>

<p>Hromund replied: "You will die before me."</p>

<p>Then he leapt upon Voli and caught him up and
dashed him down against the ice, so that his neck-bone
was broken. There lay the great sorcerer dead!
But Hromund sat him down on the ice, saying:</p>

<p>"I did not take the girl's advice, so now I have
got fourteen wounds; and in addition to that my
eight brothers lie slain, and my good blade Mistletoe
has fallen into the lake, and nothing will ever make
up to me for the loss of my sword."</p>

<p>Then he went back to his tent and got some rest.</p>

<a name="hg8" id="hg8"></a>
<p class="indent">VIII.<a href="#nhg8">°</a> &nbsp;Now the King's sisters were sent for.
Svanhvit examined Hromund's wound, and stitched
his stomach together and tried to bring him round.
She got him taken to a man called Hagal to be cured.
This man's wife was very skilful, and they made
him welcome and nursed him back to health. Hromund
discovered that the couple were skilled in
magic.</p>

<p>The man was a fisherman, and one day when he
was fishing, he caught a pike, and on going home
and cutting it open he found Hromund's sword
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page75" id="page75"></a>[pg 75]</span>
Mistletoe in its maw, and gave it to him. Hromund
was glad to get it and kissed the sword-hilt and
rewarded the peasant richly.</p>

<p>In King Hadding's army was a man called Blind
the Evil. He told the King that Hromund was alive
and was being nursed secretly in the home of the
peasant couple. The King refused to believe it,
declaring that they would not dare to conceal him;
but he ordered a search to be made. Blind and some
other men went to the dwelling of Hagal and his
wife and asked if Hromund was under their care.
The woman said he would not be found there. Blind
searched thoroughly, but did not find Hromund because
the woman had hidden him under her cauldron.
Blind and his companions went away, and when they
had gone some distance Blind said:</p>

<p>"Our quest has not been fruitful. We must go
back again."</p>

<p>They did so. They went back and found the
woman. Blind told her that she was a crafty one and
had hidden Hromund under her cauldron.</p>

<p>"Look there then and see if you can find him,"
said she. This she said because, when she saw them
returning, she had dressed Hromund in woman's
clothes and set him to grind and turn the handmill.
The men now made search in the house and when
they came upon the girl turning the handmill they
sniffed all round the place, but she cast an unfriendly
look on the King's men, and they went away
again without finding anything.</p>

<p>And when they had gone away, Blind said that
the peasant's wife had made things look different
from what they were, and he had his suspicions that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page76" id="page76"></a>[pg 76]</span>
it must have been Hromund who was turning the
mill, dressed as a woman.&mdash;"And I see we have
been deceived. We shall do no good struggling with
the woman for she is more cunning than we."</p>

<p>They cursed her and went back home to the King, leaving
matters as they stood.</p>

<p class="indent">IX. &nbsp;In the following winter Blind saw many
things in a dream, and on one occasion he told his
dream to the King, saying:</p>

<p>"I dreamed that a wolf came running from the
east, and bit you and wounded you, O King."</p>

<p>The King said he would interpret his dream as
follows:</p>

<p>"A King will come here from some other land,
and his coming will be terrible at first; yet afterwards
peace will be brought about."</p>

<p>And Blind said that he dreamed he saw many
hawks perched on a house&mdash;"And there I espied
your falcon, Sire. He was all bare and stripped of
his feathers."</p>

<p>The King said: "A wind will come from the clouds
and shake our castle."</p>

<p>Blind related a third dream as follows.</p>

<p>"I saw a herd of swine running from the south
towards the King's hall and rooting up the earth
with their snouts."</p>

<p>The King said: "That signifies the flood-tide, wet
weather, and grass springing from moisture, when
the sun shines on the heath."</p>

<p>Blind related a fourth dream:</p>

<p>"I thought I saw a terrible giant come hither
from the east; he gave you a great wound with his
teeth."</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page77" id="page77"></a>[pg 77]</span>

<p>The King said: "Messengers from some King
will come into my hall. They will provoke enmity
and I shall be angered thereby."</p>

<p>"Here is a fifth dream," said Blind; "I dreamed
that a terrible serpent lay coiled round Sweden."</p>

<p>"A splendid warship will land here, loaded with
jewels," said the King.</p>

<p>"I had a sixth dream," said Blind; "I dreamed
that dark clouds came over the land with claws and
wings, and flew away with thee, O King; and I
dreamed moreover that there was a serpent in the
house of Hagal the peasant. He attacked people in
a terrible manner. He devoured both you and me
and all the men belonging to the court. Now what
can that signify?"</p>

<p>The King said: "I have heard that there is a bear
lurking not far from Hagal's dwelling. I will go and
attack the bear, and it will be in a great rage."</p>

<p>"Next I dreamed that a dragon's form had been
drawn round the King's hall, and Hromund's belt
was hanging from it."</p>

<p>The King said: "You know that Hromund lost
his sword and belt in the lake; and are you afraid of
Hromund after that?"</p>

<p>Blind dreamed yet more dreams which he told to
the King; and the King interpreted them all to his
liking, and none of them according to their real
significance.</p>

<p>But now Blind related one more dream&mdash;this time
one which concerned himself.</p>

<p>"I dreamed that an iron ring was fixed round my
neck."</p>

<p>The King said: "The meaning of this dream is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page78" id="page78"></a>[pg 78]</span>
that you are going to be hanged; and that will be
the end of both of us."</p>

<a name="hg10" id="hg10"></a>
<p class="indent">X.<a href="#nhg10">°</a> &nbsp;After that King Olaf gathered together an
army and went to Sweden. Hromund accompanied
him, and they took the hall of King Hadding by
surprise. He was in bed in an outer chamber, and
was not aware of their presence till they smashed
in the door of his room. Hadding shouted to his
men and asked who was disturbing the peace of the
night. Hromund told him who they were.</p>

<p>The King said: "You are anxious to avenge your
brothers."</p>

<p>Hromund said that he had not come to waste
words about the death of his brothers, adding&mdash;"Now
you will have to pay for it and perish on the spot."</p>

<p>Then one of King Hadding's champions, as big
as a giant, leapt up; but Hromund slew him. King
Hadding covered himself up in bed and got no
wound, because every time Hromund cut down at
him, the sword turned and came down flat on him.
Then Hromund took a club and beat King Hadding
to death.</p>

<p>Then said Hromund: "Here I have laid low King
Hadding, the most famous man I have ever seen."</p>

<p>The man Blind, who was also called Bavis, was bound
and then hanged; and so his dream was fulfilled.</p>

<p>They got a quantity of gold and other booty there,
and then went home. King Olaf married Svanhvit
to Hromund. They were devoted to one another,
and had a family of sons and daughters; they were
people of great distinction in every respect. Kings
and great champions sprang from their stock.</p>

<p class="ind1">Here ends the Saga of Hromund Greipsson.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page79" id="page79"></a>[pg 79]</span>

<h3 style="margin-top: 3em;">INTRODUCTION TO THE SAGA OF HERVÖR AND HEITHREK</h3>

<p>The <i>Saga of Hervör and Heithrek</i> is found in two
vellums, the <i>Hauksbók</i> (<span class="sc">a.m.</span> 544), dating from c. 1325,
which for convenience is usually called <i>H</i>; and
<span class="sc">ms</span>. 2845<a id="footnotetagiv1" name="footnotetagiv1"></a><a href="#footnoteiv1"><sup>1</sup></a> in the Royal Library at Copenhagen,
dating from the fifteenth century, and generally
called <i>R</i>. Besides these there are a number of paper
<span class="sc">mss</span>. (h) dating from the seventeenth century. According
to Bugge<a id="footnotetagiv2" name="footnotetagiv2"></a><a href="#footnoteiv2"><sup>2</sup></a>, these have no independent value
and can contribute nothing to our knowledge of
the text up to the point at which the vellums break
off. They are useful however as continuing the
Saga beyond this point. <i>H</i> comes to an end with
Gestumblindi's second riddle, while <i>R</i> breaks off
just before the close of ch. 12. Beyond this point we
are entirely dependent on the paper <span class="sc">mss</span>. One of
these (<span class="sc">a.m.</span> 345 written in 1694) was adopted by
Rafn<a id="footnotetagiv3" name="footnotetagiv3"></a><a href="#footnoteiv3"><sup>3</sup></a> as the text for his edition of the Saga, though
he gives <i>H</i> in full as an Appendix.</p>

<p>The <span class="sc">mss</span>. differ considerably among themselves.
For instance <i>R</i> omits the first chapter of the Saga,
but contains <i>Hjalmar's Death Song</i>. Here, too, many
of the riddles are wanting, and the order of the rest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page80" id="page80"></a>[pg 80]</span>
is quite different from that of <i>h</i>. Finnur Jónsson<a id="footnotetagiv4" name="footnotetagiv4"></a><a href="#footnoteiv4"><sup>4</sup></a> is
of the opinion that <i>R</i> is the best text throughout;
but Heusler<a id="footnotetagiv5" name="footnotetagiv5"></a><a href="#footnoteiv5"><sup>5</sup></a>, like Valdimar Ásmundarson, keeps
the order of the riddles as in <i>h</i>. Petersen<a id="footnotetagiv6" name="footnotetagiv6"></a><a href="#footnoteiv6"><sup>6</sup></a> regards
<i>H</i> as the best text and follows it so far as it goes; but
when it breaks off he follows <i>R</i> mainly, although he
considers the latter <span class="sc">ms</span>. to be defective in many places,
"at the beginning, middle and end." He has supplied
the lacunae in it from Arn. Magn. 192, the paper
<span class="sc">ms</span>. which comes nearest to it, and also from others
but with greater reservation. Valdimar Ásmundarson,
like Petersen, and no doubt influenced by him, has
followed <i>H</i> very closely in his edition of the Saga<a id="footnotetagiv7" name="footnotetagiv7"></a><a href="#footnoteiv7"><sup>7</sup></a>
till it breaks off, and after that the paper <span class="sc">mss</span>. (<i>h</i>)
most closely related to it. He does not appear to have
used <i>R</i>, and therefore omits the details of the fight on
Samsø and <i>Hjalmar's Death Song</i>. Ásmundarson's
version has been followed closely in the translation
given below, but one or two interesting passages
omitted by <i>H</i> have been translated separately (see
Appendix on pp. 144-150) from the text printed from
<i>R</i> in Wimmer's <i>Oldnordisk Læsebog</i><a id="footnotetagiv8" name="footnotetagiv8"></a><a href="#footnoteiv8"><sup>8</sup></a> and from some
short excerpts from <i>h</i> printed at the close of Petersen's
edition of the Saga.</p>

<p>For a full bibliography of the texts, translations,
and literature dealing with this saga the reader is
referred to <i>Islandica</i>, Vol. <span class="sc">v</span>, pp. 22-26.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page81" id="page81"></a>[pg 81]</span>

<p>In this saga we have what appears to be the
history of a certain family for more than four
generations. From the point of view of construction,
the story can hardly be regarded as a success. Yet
it contains scenes at least equal to any others which
can be found among sagas of this kind. It also
embodies a considerable amount of poetry which is
not found elsewhere. Some of this is of high merit,
and one piece, dealing with the battle between the
Huns and the Goths, is evidently of great antiquity.</p>

<p>The Saga opens in a purely mythical milieu&mdash;with
Guthmund in Glasisvellir, to whom we have already
had reference in the story of Nornagest. Next we
have a typical story of the Viking Age&mdash;the adventures
of the sons of Arngrim and their fight on
Samsø. This story is known to us from other sources,
the earliest being the poem <ins title="transcriber's note: original read 'Hyndlulj&#x1e53;th'. Other occurence in this book: 'Hyndluljóth'; elsewhere: 'Hyndluljóð' (Wikipedia)"><i>Hyndluljóth</i></ins> (str. 24),
which according to Finnur Jónsson<a id="footnotetagiv9" name="footnotetagiv9"></a><a href="#footnoteiv9"><sup>9</sup></a> cannot be later in
date than the latter part of the tenth century, though
Mogk<a id="footnotetagiv10" name="footnotetagiv10"></a><a href="#footnoteiv10"><sup>10</sup></a> is inclined to doubt this. Other references
occur in the <i>Saga of Örvar-Odd</i>, Saxo's <i>Danish
History</i>, the later ballads translated below, etc.</p>

<p>We then pass on to the account of Hervör, the
daughter of Angantyr (which is only found here and
in the ballads), and the striking poem in which she
is represented as visiting her father's grave-mound to
obtain his sword.</p>

<p>The next and longest section contains the life of
Hervör's son Heithrek, which is peculiar to this
saga and which in its earlier part likewise seems to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page82" id="page82"></a>[pg 82]</span>
a story of the Viking Age. Towards the end, however,
it gradually dawns upon us that there has been
an unconscious change of scene, and that Heithrek
instead of being a Viking prince of the Northern
coasts, is now represented as a King of the Goths,
somewhere in the East of Europe&mdash;apparently in
the neighbourhood of the Dnieper. In the last
section of the story, dealing with the adventures of
Angantyr and Hlöth, the sons of Heithrek, there
is no longer any reminiscence of the Viking Age or
the North of Europe. Here we are away back among
the Goths and Huns in the fifth or the latter part of
the fourth century.</p>

<p>Throughout this strange concatenation of scenes
a connecting link is afforded by the magic flaming
sword, which is handed on from generation to
generation, and which can never be sheathed without
having dealt a death wound.</p>

<p>It is abundantly clear that the latter part of the
story is of a totally different origin from the first part,
and in reality many centuries earlier. The prose here
is for the most part little more than a paraphrase of
the poem, which probably has its roots in poetry of
the Gothic period. But how this story came to be
joined on to a narrative of the Viking Age is far from
clear.</p>

<p>It is also interesting to note that some of the
characters in the saga are repetitions of one another.
At all events what is said about Hervör the daughter
of Heithrek in the latter part of the story bears a
strong resemblance to the description of the more
prominent Hervör, the daughter of Angantyr, in
the first part.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page83" id="page83"></a>[pg 83]</span>

<p>Three poems of considerable length are preserved
in the story. The Riddles of Gestumblindi, though
somewhat tedious as a whole, afford a better
specimen of this type of composition than is to
be found elsewhere in early Norse literature. They
cannot fail to be of considerable interest to anyone
who studies the Anglo-Saxon Riddles, though
unlike the latter they are wholly Teutonic in spirit
and form. Direct Latin influence appears to be
entirely absent.</p>

<p>Gestumblindi's Riddles, while they belong essentially
to popular literature, yet contain many arresting
phrases which show a minute observation of nature.
They illustrate the condensed, proverbial type of
wisdom that prevails in a primitive state of society,
as well as its keen interest and delight in the little
things of life. They can hardly be called literature
as we understand the term; they are rather the stuff
of which literature is made. But though it is a far
cry from these little nature verses to the more beautiful
and more ambitious nature poems of Burns and
Tennyson, yet Gestumblindi's loving interest in
"every creature of earth" surprised even King
Heithrek into comment. The keen and whimsical
observation that noted that even a spider is a
"marvel" and that it "carries its knees higher than
its body" is the same spirit that inspired a poem to
the</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Wee sleekit, cowrin', tim'rous beastie.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>The poet who noticed that water falling as hail on
rock looks <i>white</i> by contrast, yet forms little <i>black</i>
circles when it falls into the sand as rain, had much
in common with one who noticed that rock and sand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page84" id="page84"></a>[pg 84]</span>
yield opposite sounds when struck by the same
object&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Low on the sand and loud on the stone</p>
<p>The last wheel echoed away.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>But though these things are pleasing in themselves,
they are, of course, slight. Gestumblindi
cannot rise to the heights of true poetry reached
by Burns or Tennyson.</p>

<p>Besides the Riddles, this saga has preserved for
us two far finer poems&mdash;in fact two of the finest
Norse poems that we possess&mdash;the dialogue between
Hervör and Angantyr at the Barrows of Samsø, and
the narrative of the great battle between the Goths and
the Huns, the <i>Chevy Chase</i> of the North. The ruthlessness
and barbaric splendour of the Hunnish
leaders, the cruelty and the poetry of warfare a thousand
years ago, are here vividly depicted in Norse
verse at its simplest and best.</p>

<p>We may notice too the little vignettes that appear
from time to time both in the poetry itself and in the
prose narrative, some of which is evidently derived
from lost verses.&mdash;Hervör standing at sunrise on the
summit of the tower and looking southward towards
the forest; Angantyr marshalling his men for battle
and remarking drily that there used to be more of
them when mead drinking was in question; great
clouds of dust rolling over the plain, through which
glittered white corslet and golden helmet, as the
Hunnish host came riding on.</p>

<p>The dialogue between Hervör and Angantyr,
despite a certain melodramatic element in the setting,
is treated with great delicacy and poetic feeling, and
an atmosphere of terror and mystery pervades the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page85" id="page85"></a>[pg 85]</span>
whole poem. The midnight scene in the eerie and
deserted burial-ground, the lurid flickering of the
grave fires along the lonely beach, the tombs opening
one by one as the corpses start to life&mdash;all these work
on the imagination and create an atmosphere of
dread. The poet understood the technique of presenting
the supernatural, and he is deliberately vague
and suggestive. Much more is implied than is stated,
and much is left to the imagination.</p>

<p>The greatest charm of the poem, however, lies
in the sympathetic treatment of Hervör. The Hervör
of the prose narrative is perfectly consistent with the
Hervör of the poem, but at the same time the poem&mdash;which
is probably more than a century older than
the saga&mdash;would lead us to conclude that her character
was not correctly understood by the writer of
the saga. Obviously unsympathetic, he denounces
her with an indignation which would have made the
writer of the poem smile.</p>

<p>"She grew up to be a beautiful girl ... but as soon
as she could do anything it was oftener harm than
good; and when she had been checked she escaped
to the woods.... And when the Earl heard of it he
had her caught and brought home."</p>

<p>The picture which the poem presents to us is
that of a high-spirited girl, headstrong and impulsive,
not unlike Brynhild in the Völsung story. When
she goes to the barrows, every nerve is strung
up to gain the treasure that has fired her imagination:</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>What care I though the death-fires blaze,</p>
<p>They sink and tremble before my gaze,</p>
<p class="i6">They quiver out and die!</p>
  </div>  </div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page86" id="page86"></a>[pg 86]</span>

<p>But a reaction comes when she holds the sword
in her hands at last:</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Surely in terror I drew my breath</p>
<p>Between the worlds of life and death</p>
<p class="i6">When the grave fires girt me round.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Surveying the saga as a whole, perhaps the most
striking feature is its extraordinary diversity of
interest. It would be difficult to find elsewhere in
Norse literature&mdash;or indeed perhaps in any literature&mdash;so
great a variety of subjects and of literary forms
brought together within such narrow limits.</p>

<p>Of the poems contained in the saga, the first is
romantic, the second gnomic, the third heroic&mdash;and
the prose narrative itself is not less varied in
character. The conclusion of the saga appears to be
purely historical; indeed it is generally regarded
as one of the most important authorities for early
Swedish history. Elsewhere also historical elements
are probably not wanting, but they are interwoven
in a network of romance and folklore. Thus whoever
King Heithrek may have been, the part which
he has come to play in the saga is chiefly that of
linking together a number of folk-tales and illustrating
popular saws. As regards chronology, the
war described in ch. 12-15 must belong to a period
nearly seven centuries before the incidents related
at the close of the saga. Still more strange is the
fact that the victor in this war, the younger Angantyr,
would seem to have lived some four or five centuries
before his great grandfather and namesake who
perished at Samsø&mdash;if indeed the latter story rests
on any genuine tradition. In spite of these and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page87" id="page87"></a>[pg 87]</span>
similar inconsistencies, however, the saga is on
the whole perhaps the most attractive of all the
<i>Fornaldarsögur</i>.</p>

<h3 style="margin-top: 3em;">THE SAGA OF HERVÖR AND HEITHREK<a href="#nhh1">°</a></h3>

<p>Here begins the Saga of King Heithrek the Wise.</p>

<p class="indent">I. &nbsp;It is said that in the days of old the northern part
of Finnmark was called Jötunheimar, and that there
was a country called Ymisland to the south between
it and Halogaland. These lands were then the home
of many giants and half-giants; for there was a great
intermixture of races at that time, because the giants
took wives from among the people of Ymisland.</p>

<p>There was a king in Jötunheimar called Guthmund.
He was a mighty man among the heathen. He dwelt
at a place called Grund in the region of Glasisvellir.
He was wise and mighty. He and his men lived for
many generations, and so heathen men believed that
the fields of immortality lay in his realm; and whoever
went there cast off sickness or old age and became
immortal.</p>

<p>After Guthmund's death, people worshipped him
and called him their god. His son's name was
Höfund. He had second sight and was wise of
understanding, and was judge of all suits throughout
the neighbouring kingdoms. He never gave an unjust
judgment, and no-one dared violate his decision.</p>

<p>There was a man called Hergrim who was a giant
dwelling in the rocks. He carried off from Ymisland
Ama the daughter of Ymir, and afterwards married
her. Their son Thorgrim Halftroll took from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page88" id="page88"></a>[pg 88]</span>
Jötunheimar Ögn Alfasprengi, and afterwards married
her. Their son was called Grim. She had been
betrothed to Starkath Aludreng, who had eight
hands; but she was carried off while he was away to
the north of Elivagar. When he came home he
slew Hergrim in single combat; but Ögn ran herself
through with a sword rather than marry Starkath.
After that Starkath carried off Alfhild the daughter
of King Alf from Alfheimar, but he was afterwards
slain by Thor.</p>

<p>Then Alfhild went to her kinsfolk, and Grim was
with her there till he went raiding and became a great
warrior. He married Bauggerth the daughter of
Starkath Aludreng and set up his dwelling on an
island off Halogaland called Bolm. He was called
Ey-grim Bolm. His son by Bauggerth was called
Arngrim the Berserk, who afterwards lived in Bolm
and was a very famous man.</p>

<a name="hh2" id="hh2"></a>
<p class="indent">II.<a href="#nhh2">°</a> &nbsp;There was a King called Sigrlami who was
said to be a son of Othin. His son Svafrlami succeeded
to the kingdom after his father and was a very
great warrior. One day as the King rode a-hunting
he got separated from his men, and at sunset he
came upon a big stone and two dwarfs beside it. The
King banned them with his graven sword from entering
the stone. The dwarfs begged him to spare their lives.</p>

<p>The King said: "What are your names?"</p>

<p>One of them said his name was Dvalin and the
other Dulin.</p>

<p>The King said: "As you are the most cunning of
all dwarfs you must make me a sword, the best you
can. The hilt and the grip must be of gold, and it
must cut iron as easily as if it were cloth and never
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page89" id="page89"></a>[pg 89]</span>
rust; and it must bring victory to whoever uses it
in battle and single combat."</p>

<p>They agreed to this, and the King rode away home.</p>

<p>And when the appointed day came, the King rode
to the stone. The dwarfs were outside, and they
handed to the King a sword which was very beautiful.</p>

<p>But as Dvalin was standing in the doorway of the
stone he said:</p>

<p>"Your sword, Svafrlami, will be the death of a
man every time it is drawn; and moreover it will be
the instrument of three pieces of villainy; and to you
yourself also it shall bring death."</p>

<p>Then the King struck at the dwarfs with the
sword. But they sprang into the stone, and the
sword came down on it&mdash;sinking so deep that both
the ridges of the blade were hidden; for the door into
the stone closed as they disappeared. The King called
the sword 'Tyrfing,' and ever afterwards he carried it
in battle and single combat, and was always victorious.</p>

<p>The King had a daughter who was called Eyfura,
an exceedingly beautiful and clever girl.</p>

<p>At that time Arngrim was raiding among the
Perms in the Baltic. He raided the Kingdom of
King Svafrlami and fought against him. They met
face to face, and King Svafrlami struck at Arngrim
who parried the blow with his shield; but the lower
part of the shield was cut away and the sword plunged
into the earth. Then Arngrim struck off the King's
hand, so that he had to let Tyrfing fall. Arngrim
caught up Tyrfing and cut down first the King, and
then many others. He took great booty there, and
carried off Eyfura, the King's daughter and took her
to his home in Bolm.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page90" id="page90"></a>[pg 90]</span>

<p>By her he had twelve sons. The eldest was Angantyr,
then Hervarth, then Hjörvarth, Sæming and
Hrani, Brami, Barri, Reifnir, Tind and Bui, and the
two Haddings who only did one man's work between
them, because they were twins and the youngest of the
family; whereas Angantyr, who was a head taller than
other men, did the work of two. They were all berserks,
and were unequalled in strength and courage.
Even when they went marauding there were never
more than just the twelve brothers on one ship.
They raided far and wide in many lands, and had
much success and won great renown. Angantyr had
Tyrfing, and Sæming Mistletoe, Hervarth had
Hrotti, and each of the others possessed a sword
famous in single combat. And it was their custom
when they had only their own men with them, to
land when they felt the berserks' fury coming upon
them, and wrestle with trees or great rocks; for they
had been known to slay their own men and disable
their ship. Great tales were told about them and they
became very famous.</p>

<a name="hh3" id="hh3"></a>
<p class="indent">III.<a href="#nhh3">°</a> &nbsp;One Yule Eve at Bolm, Angantyr made a vow
over the pledge cup, as the custom then was, that he
would wed Ingibjörg the daughter of King Yngvi
of Upsala&mdash;the cleverest and most beautiful maiden
in all the Northlands&mdash;or perish in the attempt and
marry no-one else. No more of their vows are recorded.</p>

<p>Tyrfing had this characteristic, that whenever it
was unsheathed it shone like a sunbeam, even in the
dark, and could only be sheathed with human blood
still warm upon it. Never did he whose blood was
shed by Tyrfing live to see another day. It is very
famous in all stories of the olden days.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page91" id="page91"></a>[pg 91]</span>

<p>Next summer the brothers went to Upsala in
Sweden, and when they had entered the hall,
Angantyr told the King his vow and that he intended
to wed his daughter.</p>

<p>Everybody in the hall listened. Angantyr asked
the King to declare what was to be the result of their
errand, whereupon Hjalmar the stout-hearted rose
from the table, and addressed the King:</p>

<p>"Call to mind, Sire, how much honour I have won
for you since I came into your kingdom, and how
many times I have risked my life for you. In return
for these my services I beg that you will give me
your daughter in marriage. And moreover I consider
myself more deserving a favourable answer than these
berserks, who do harm to everyone."</p>

<p>The King pondered over the matter, and found it
difficult to decide the question in such a way as to give
rise to as little trouble as possible; and he answered
at last:</p>

<p>"My wish is that Ingibjörg should choose for
herself the husband she prefers."</p>

<p>She replied: "If you want to marry me to anyone,
then I would rather have a man whose good qualities
I know already than one of whom I have only known
by hearsay, and nothing but evil at that."</p>

<p>Angantyr said: "I will not bandy words with
you; for I can see that you love Hjalmar. But as for
you, Hjalmar, come south to Samsø and meet me in
single combat. If you do not appear next midsummer
you will be a coward in the eyes of all
men."</p>

<p>Hjalmar said that he would not fail to come and
fight, and the sons of Arngrim went home to their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page92" id="page92"></a>[pg 92]</span>
father and told him what had happened. He replied
that this was the first time he had ever felt any
anxiety on their behalf.</p>

<p>They spent the winter at home, and in the spring
made ready to start, going first to Earl Bjartmar, where
a feast was made for them. And during the evening
Angantyr asked the Earl for the hand of his daughter
and in this as in the rest they got their wish. The
wedding took place, and afterwards the sons of
Arngrim prepared to set out. But the night before
they left, Angantyr had a dream which he related to
the Earl:</p>

<p>"I dreamed that I and my brothers were in Samsø.
We found many birds there and killed all that we
saw. Then I dreamed that as we were setting out
again upon the island, two eagles flew towards us.
I went against one and we had a stiff encounter; and
at last we sank down and had no strength left in us.
But the other eagle fought with my eleven brothers
and overcame them all."</p>

<p>The Earl said: "The death of mighty men has
been revealed to you in this dream."</p>

<p>Then Angantyr and his brothers went away and
came to Samsø, and went ashore to look for Hjalmar;
and the story of their adventures there is related in
the <i>Saga of Örvar-Odd</i>. First they came to Munarvagar,
where they slew all the men from the two ships
of Hjalmar and Odd; and afterwards they went
ashore and encountered Hjalmar and Odd themselves
on the island. Odd slew Angantyr's eleven
brothers, and Hjalmar slew Angantyr, and afterwards
died there himself of his wounds.</p>

<p>Then Odd had all the rest of them placed in great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page93" id="page93"></a>[pg 93]</span>
barrows with all their weapons; but Hjalmar's body
he took home to Sweden. And when Ingibjörg the
King's daughter saw Hjalmar's body, she fell down
dead and they were both laid together in one barrow
at Upsala.</p>

<a name="hh4" id="hh4"></a>
<p class="indent">IV.<a href="#nhh4">°</a> &nbsp;The story goes on to say that a girl was
born to the daughter of Earl Bjartmar. Everyone
advised exposing the child, saying that if she resembled
her father's kinsmen she would not have a
womanly disposition. The Earl, however, had her
sprinkled with water; and he brought her up, and
called her Hervör, saying that the line of Arngrim's
sons would not be extinguished if she were left
alive.</p>

<p>She grew up to be a beautiful girl. She was tall
and strong, and trained herself in the use of bow,
shield and sword. But as soon as she could do anything
it was oftener harm than good; and when she
had been checked she ran away to the woods and
killed people to provide herself with money. And
when the Earl heard of it, he had her caught and
brought home, where she remained for a time.</p>

<p>One day she went to the Earl and said: "I want
to go away because I am not happy here."</p>

<p>A little while after she departed alone, dressed
and armed like a man, and joined some vikings and
stayed with them for a time, calling herself Hervarth.
Shortly afterwards the chief of the vikings died, and
Hervarth took command of the band.</p>

<p>One day when they sailed to Samsø, Hervarth
landed; but her men would not follow her, saying
that it was not safe for anyone to be out of doors
there by night. Hervarth declared that there was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page94" id="page94"></a>[pg 94]</span>
likely to be much treasure in the barrows. She
landed on the island towards sunset, but they lay
off in Munarvagar. She met a shepherd boy and
asked him for information.</p>

<p>He said: "You are a stranger to the island; but
come home with me, for it is unsafe for anyone to be
out of doors here after sunset; and I am in a hurry to
get home."</p>

<p>Hervarth replied: "Tell me where are 'Hjörvarth's
Barrows,' as they are called."</p>

<p>"You must surely be mad," replied the boy, "if
you want to explore by night what no-one dare visit
at mid-day. Burning flame plays over them as soon
as the sun has set."</p>

<p>But Hervarth insisted that she would visit the
barrows&mdash;whereupon the shepherd said:</p>

<p>"I see that you are a brave man though not a wise
one, so I will give you my necklace if you will come
home with me."</p>

<p>But Hervarth replied: "Even if you give me all
you have you will not hold me back."</p>

<p>And when the sun had set, loud rumblings were
heard all over the island, and flames leapt out of the
barrows. Then the shepherd grew frightened and
took to his heels and ran to the wood as fast as he
could, without once looking back. Here is a poem
giving an account of his talk with Hervör:</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">

<p>She could now see the fires of the barrows and the

they had been merely smoke, until she reached the

<p>It now seemed as if the barrows, which had opened,
were surrounded with an unbroken ring of flame.
Then Angantyr cried:</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">

Two lines are missing from the <span class="sc">ms</span>. at this point.</p>

<p>Then she returned towards her ships; but when
dawn came, she saw that they had departed. The
vikings had been scared by the rumblings and the
flames on the island. She got a ship to carry her
away; but nothing is told of her voyage till she came
to Guthmund in Glasisvellir, where she remained all
through the winter, still calling herself Hervarth.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page101" id="page101"></a>[pg 101]</span>

<a name="hh6" id="hh6"></a>
<p class="indent">VI.<a href="#nhh6">°</a> &nbsp;One day Guthmund was playing chess, and
when the game was almost up, he asked if anyone
could advise him as to his moves. So Hervarth went
up to him and began to direct his moves; and it was not
long before Guthmund began to win. Then somebody
took up Tyrfing and drew it. When Hervarth saw
this, he snatched the sword out of his hands, and
slew him, and then left the room. They wanted to
rush out in pursuit, but Guthmund said:</p>

<p>"Don't stir&mdash;you will not be avenged on the
man so easily as you think, for you don't know who
he is. This woman-man will cost you dear before
you take his life."</p>

<p>After that Hervör spent a long time in piracy and
had great success. And when she grew tired of that
she went home to the Earl, her mother's father.
There she behaved like other girls, working at her
embroidery and fine needlework.</p>

<p>Höfund, the son of Guthmund, heard of this and
went and asked for the hand of Hervör, and was
accepted; and he took her home.</p>

<p>Höfund was a very wise man and so just in his
judgments that he never swerved from giving a
correct decision, whether the persons involved were
natives or foreigners. And it is from him that the
'höfund' or judge of law-suits takes his name in
every realm.</p>

<p>He and Hervör had two sons. One was called
Angantyr, the other Heithrek. They were both big
strong men&mdash;sensible and handsome. Angantyr
resembled his father in character and was kindly
disposed towards everyone. Höfund loved him very
much, as indeed did everybody. But however much
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page102" id="page102"></a>[pg 102]</span>
good he did, Heithrek did still more evil. He was
Hervör's favourite. His foster-father was called
Gizur.</p>

<p>One day Höfund held a feast and invited all the
chief men in his kingdom except Heithrek. This
greatly displeased him, but he put in an appearance
all the same, declaring that he would do them some
mischief. And when he entered the hall, Angantyr
rose and went to meet him and invited him to sit
beside him. Heithrek was not cheerful, but he sat
till late in the evening after Angantyr had gone;
and then he turned to the men who sat on either side
of him and worked upon them by his conversation
in such a way that they became infuriated with each
other. But when Angantyr came back he told them
to be quiet. And when Angantyr went out a second
time, Heithrek reminded them of his words, and
worked upon them to such an extent that one of them
struck the other. Then Angantyr returned and persuaded
them to keep the peace till morning. And
the third time Angantyr went away, Heithrek asked
the man who had been struck why he had not the
courage to avenge himself. And so effective did his
persuasion prove that he who had been struck sprang
up and slew his companion. When Angantyr
returned, he was displeased at what had taken place.
And when Höfund heard of it, he told Heithrek that
he must either leave his kingdom or forfeit his life.</p>

<p>So Heithrek went out, and his brother with him.
Then his mother came up and gave him Tyrfing.
And Heithrek said to her:</p>

<p>"I don't know when I shall be able to show as
much difference in my treatment of my father and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page103" id="page103"></a>[pg 103]</span>
mother as they do in their treatment of me. My
father proclaims me an outlaw while my mother has
given me Tyrfing, which is of more account to me
than a great territory. But I shall do that very thing
that will most distress my father."</p>

<p>He then drew the sword, which gleamed and
flashed brilliantly, and then he got into a great rage
and showed the berserk's fury coming upon him.
The two brothers were alone. Now since Tyrfing
had to be the death of a man every time it was drawn,
Heithrek dealt his brother his death-blow. Höfund
was told of it, and Heithrek escaped at once to the
woods. Höfund had a funeral feast made for his
son Angantyr, and he was lamented by everybody.</p>

<p>Heithrek got little joy of his deed and lived in the
woods for a long time, shooting deer and bears for
food. And when he came to think over his position,
he reflected that there would be but a poor tale to
tell if no-one was to know what had become of him;
and it occurred to him that he could even yet become
a man famous for deeds of prowess like his ancestors
before him. So he went home and sought out his
mother and begged her to ask his father to give him
some sound advice before they parted. She went to
Höfund and asked him to give their son sound
advice. Höfund replied that he would give him a
little, but added that it would turn out to his disadvantage
nevertheless; he said however that he
would not ignore his request:</p>

<p>"In the first place he must not aid a man who has
slain his liege lord. Secondly, he must not protect a
man who has slain one of his comrades. Thirdly, his
wife ought not to be always leaving home to visit her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page104" id="page104"></a>[pg 104]</span>
relatives. Fourthly, he ought not to stay out late
with his sweetheart. Fifthly, he should not ride his
best horse when he is in a hurry. Sixthly, he ought
not to bring up the child of a man in a better position
than himself. Seventhly, let him always be cheerful
towards one who comes for hospitality. Eighthly,
he should never lay Tyrfing on the ground.&mdash;Yet he
will not get any benefit from this advice."</p>

<p>His mother repeated these maxims to him.</p>

<p>Heithrek replied: "This advice must have been
given me in a spiteful spirit. It will not be of any
use to me."</p>

<p>His mother gave him a mark of gold at parting,
and bade him always bear in mind how sharp his
sword was, and how great renown had been won by
everyone who had borne it&mdash;what great protection its
sharp edges afforded to him who wielded it in battle
or single combat, and what great success it always
had.&mdash;Then they parted.</p>

<p>He went on his way; and when he had gone a
short distance he came upon some men who were
leading a man in bonds. Heithrek asked what the
man had done, and they replied that he had betrayed
his liege lord. He asked if they would accept money
as his ransom, and they said that they were willing
to do so. He ransomed the man for half his gold
mark.</p>

<p>The man then offered to serve him, but Heithrek
replied:</p>

<p>"You would not be faithful to a stranger like me,
seeing that you betrayed your liege lord to whom you
owed many benefits."</p>

<p>Shortly after he again came upon some men, of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page105" id="page105"></a>[pg 105]</span>
whom one was in bonds. He asked what this man
had done, and they replied that he had murdered
one of his comrades. He freed him with the other
half of his gold mark. This man also offered to serve
him, but Heithrek declined.</p>

<p>After that he went on his way till he came to
Reithgotaland, where he went to the King who
ruled there. His name was Harold, and he was an
old man at the time. Heithrek remained for a time
with the King, who gave him a cordial welcome.</p>

<a name="hh7" id="hh7"></a>
<p class="indent">VII.<a href="#nhh7">°</a> &nbsp;There were two Earls who had plundered
the kingdom of King Harold and made it subject
to them, and because he was old he paid them tribute
every year. Heithrek grew intimate with the King,
and eventually it came about that he became the
commander of his army and betook himself to
raiding, and soon made himself famous for his
victories. He proceeded to make war on the Earls
who had subdued King Harold's kingdom, and a
stiff fight took place between them. Heithrek fought
with Tyrfing and, as in the past, no-one could withstand
it, for it cut through steel as easily as cloth;
and the result was that he slew both the Earls and
put all their army to flight. He then went throughout
the kingdom and brought it under King Harold
and took hostages, and then returned home. And
as a mark of great honour, King Harold went
himself to meet him, and he acquired great fame
from this. The King gave him his daughter Helga
in marriage and with her half his kingdom. Heithrek
had the defence of the whole realm in his hands; and
this arrangement lasted for a time.</p>

<p>King Harold had a son in his old age. Heithrek
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page106" id="page106"></a>[pg 106]</span>
also had a son, who was called Angantyr. Presently
a great famine began in Reithgotaland (which is
now called Jutland) and it threatened to destroy all
the inhabitants. So they tried divination, and the
answer was that there would be no plenty in Reithgotaland
until the noblest boy in the land had been
sacrificed. Heithrek said that that was King Harold's
son, but the King declared that Heithrek's son was
the noblest; and there was no escape from this
dilemma save by referring it to Höfund, whose
decisions were always just.</p>

<p>Thereupon Heithrek went to visit his father, who
made him welcome. He asked his father's decision
about this question. Höfund pronounced Heithrek's
son to be the noblest in that land.</p>

<p>"What compensation do you adjudge to me for
my loss?" asked Heithrek.</p>

<p>"You shall claim for yourself in compensation
every second man in the retinue of King Harold.
Beyond that there is no need to give you advice,
considering your character and the army that you
have under you."</p>

<p>Then Heithrek went back and summoned a
meeting, and told them his father's opinion:</p>

<p>"He decided that it was my son who must be
sacrificed; and as compensation to me he adjudged
to me every second man of those who are with King
Harold, and I want you to swear an oath that this
shall be done."</p>

<p>And they did so. Then the people demanded that
he should give up his son and get them a better
harvest. Heithrek then talked with his men after
the force had been divided, and demanded fresh
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page107" id="page107"></a>[pg 107]</span>
oaths of allegiance from them. These they gave,
swearing to follow him whether at home or abroad,
for whatever purpose he wished.</p>

<p>Then said he: "It appears to me that Othin will
have been well compensated for one boy if he gets
in place of him King Harold and his son and all his
host!"</p>

<p>He then bade his men raise his standard and make
an attack on King Harold and slay him and all his
host, declaring that he was giving this host to Othin
instead of his own son. He caused the altars to be
reddened with the blood of King Harold and his son
Halfdan, while the Queen took her own life in the
temple of the Dís.</p>

<p>Heithrek was now accepted as King throughout
the realm. He made love to Sifka the daughter
of Humli, a prince from the land of the Huns. Their
son was called Hlöth. He was brought up with his
mother's father.</p>

<a name="hh8" id="hh8"></a>
<p class="indent">VIII.<a href="#nhh8">°</a> &nbsp;King Heithrek went out raiding and
marched against the land of the Saxons with a great
host. The King of the Saxons sent men to meet him
and they made peace with one another, and the King
invited Heithrek to a banquet. Heithrek accepted
the invitation. The result of this banquet was that
Heithrek sought the hand of the King's daughter
and married her, receiving much property and land
as her dowry; and with that King Heithrek went
home to his kingdom. She often used to ask to go
to visit her father, and Heithrek was indulgent to
her in this matter. Her stepson Angantyr used to
go with her.</p>

<p>On one occasion when Heithrek was returning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page108" id="page108"></a>[pg 108]</span>
from a raid, he lay in hiding off the land of the
Saxons. He landed during the night and entered the
building in which his wife was sleeping. He had
only one companion with him. All the sentries were
asleep. He found a handsome man asleep beside his
wife. He took his son Angantyr and carried him
away with him, and returned to his ship, having
first cut off a lock of the man's hair.</p>

<p>Next morning he lay to in the King's berth, and
all the people went to greet him; and a feast was
prepared in his honour. A little later he had a meeting
called and asked if anything was known of his son.
The Queen alleged that he had died suddenly. He
asked her to guide him to his tomb, and when she
said that that would only increase his grief, he replied
that he did not mind that. A search was made
accordingly, and a dog was found wrapped in a
shroud. Heithrek remarked that his son had not
changed for the better. Then the King caused the
man whom he had found asleep to be brought
forward, and he proved to be a bondman. Thereupon
Heithrek put away his wife, and then went
home to his kingdom.</p>

<p>One summer as Heithrek was away raiding, he
went into the land of the Huns and harried there,
and Humli his father-in-law fled before him. Heithrek
there captured great booty and also Sifka, the
daughter of King Humli, and then returned home
to his kingdom. Their son was called Hlöth, as we
said before. He sent her home shortly after. He also
captured another woman called Sifka from Finland.
She was the loveliest woman ever seen.</p>

<p>One summer he sent men east to Holmgarth to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page109" id="page109"></a>[pg 109]</span>
offer to bring up the child of King Hrollaug, the
most powerful king of the time. This he did because
he was anxious to act exactly contrary to the whole
of his father's advice. Messengers came to Holmgarth
and told their errand to the King, who had a
young son called Horlaug.</p>

<p>The King replied: "Is it likely that I shall send
him my son to bring up, when he has betrayed King
Harold his father-in-law and his other relatives and
friends?"</p>

<p>But the Queen urged: "Do not be so hasty in
refusing this, for if you do not accept his offer the
result will certainly be war. I expect it will fare with
you as with many another, and war with him will be
no trifle. Moreover he has a sword which nothing
can withstand, and the man who wields it will always
be victorious."</p>

<p>So the King resolved to send his son to Heithrek;
and Heithrek was pleased with him and brought him
up and loved him much.</p>

<p>Heithrek's father had also counselled him not to
tell secrets to his sweetheart.</p>

<a name="hh9" id="hh9"></a>
<p class="indent">IX.<a href="#nhh9">°</a> &nbsp;Every summer King Heithrek went raiding;
he always went into the Baltic where he had King
Hrollaug's friendly country at hand. On one occasion
King Hrollaug invited him to a feast, and
Heithrek consulted his friends as to whether he
should accept the invitation. They all tried to
dissuade him, bidding him bear in mind his father's
maxims.</p>

<p>"All his maxims will I disregard," he replied, and
sent word to the King that he would be present at
the feast.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page110" id="page110"></a>[pg 110]</span>

<p>He divided his host into three parts. One he
ordered to guard the ships, the second accompanied
him, while the third he ordered to go on shore and
conceal themselves in a wood near the house in which
the feast was to be held, and to be on the look out
in case he should need help. Heithrek went to the
feast, and the next day, when the Kings were seated,
Heithrek asked where the King's son, his foster-child,
was. A search was made for him, but he could
not be found. Heithrek was greatly distressed and
retired to bed early; and when Sifka joined him she
asked why he was distressed.</p>

<p>"That is a difficult matter to talk about," replied
he, "because my life is at stake if it becomes known."</p>

<p>She promised to keep the secret, adding:</p>

<p>"Tell me for the sake of the love that is between
us."</p>

<p>So Heithrek began:</p>

<p>"As I was riding to the forest yesterday looking
for sport, I caught sight of a wild boar and made a
thrust at him with my spear; but I missed my aim
and the shaft snapped. Then I leapt down from my
horse and drew Tyrfing, which was effective as
usual, and I slew the boar. But when I looked round
there was no-one by except the King's son. But it is
a peculiarity of Tyrfing that it must be sheathed with
human blood still warm upon it, so I slew the lad.
Now this will be the end of me if King Hrollaug
hears of it, because we have only a small force
here."</p>

<p>Next morning when Sifka came to the Queen, the
Queen asked her why Heithrek had been depressed.
She said that she did not dare to tell. But the Queen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page111" id="page111"></a>[pg 111]</span>
persuaded her to change her mind, so she told the
Queen all that Heithrek had told her.</p>

<p>"These are terrible tidings," cried the Queen,
and went off in deep grief and told the King; but she
added:</p>

<p>"Yet Heithrek has done this against his will."</p>

<p>"Your advice has turned out as I expected," said
the King as he left the hall to give orders to his men
to arm.</p>

<p>Heithrek had a shrewd notion as to what Sifka
had said, and ordered his men to arm themselves
secretly, and then to go out in small detachments and
try to find out what was happening.</p>

<p>A little later King Hrollaug came in and asked
Heithrek to come and have a private talk with him.
And when they entered a garden, some men sprang
at Heithrek and seized him and cast him into fetters
and bound him securely; and he recognised the two
men who bound him most tightly as the men whose
lives he had saved. The King ordered him to be taken
to the forest and hanged. There were two hundred
and forty of them all told, and when they entered the
forest, King Heithrek's men sprang out at them with
his weapons and standard and a trumpet which they
blew as they attacked their foes. Their companions
concealed in the woods heard the noise and came out
to meet King Heithrek's men. And when the natives
saw that, they all took to their heels; but most of
them were slain. The Goths took their King and
released him. Heithrek went to his ships after that,
taking with him the King's son whom he had left
with the men concealed in the wood.</p>

<p>King Hrollaug now summoned a very large force,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page112" id="page112"></a>[pg 112]</span>
and King Heithrek raided in his kingdom wherever
he went.</p>

<p>Then said King Hrollaug to the Queen:</p>

<p>"Your advice has turned out badly for me. I find
that our son is with Heithrek, and in his present state
of anger he will think nothing of making an end of
him in his criminal way, just as he slew his own
innocent brother."</p>

<p>"We have been far too easily convinced," replied
the Queen. "You saw how popular he was, when
no-one would fetter him except two bad men; and
our son is taken good care of. This has been a trick
of his to make trial of you, and you offered him a poor
return for bringing up your child. Send men to him
now, and offer to make it up with him, and to give
him so much of your territories as you may agree
upon with him; and offer him your daughter too, if
we can recover our son. That will be better than that
you should part from him in enmity. And even if
he already has wide territory, he has not a wife as
beautiful as she."</p>

<p>"I had not intended to offer her to anyone,"
replied the King; "but as you are so wise, you shall
decide."</p>

<p>Messengers were sent accordingly to King
Heithrek to bring about a reconciliation. A council
was held and a reconciliation effected by Heithrek's
marrying Hergerth, the daughter of King Hrollaug;
and she brought him as her dowry Wendland, the
province which lies nearest to Reithgotaland.</p>

<p>On one occasion the King was riding his best horse
as he was conducting Sifka home. It was late in the
evening, and when the King came to a river his horse
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page113" id="page113"></a>[pg 113]</span>
fell dead. Shortly afterwards, when Sifka attempted
to embrace him, he threw her down and broke her
leg. Afterwards King Heithrek settled down in his
own kingdom and became a great sage.</p>

<a name="hh10" id="hh10"></a>
<p class="indent">X.<a href="#nhh10">°</a> They had a daughter called Hervör who was
brought up by a man called Ormar. She was a most
beautiful girl, but as tall and strong as a man, and
trained herself in the use of bow and arrows.</p>

<p>There was a great man in Reithgotaland called
Gestumblindi, who was not on good terms with
King Heithrek.</p>

<p>In the King's retinue there were seven men whose
duty it was to decide all the disputes that arose in
that country.</p>

<p>King Heithrek worshipped Frey, and he used to
give Frey the biggest boar he could find. They regarded
it as so sacred that in all important cases they
used to take the oath on its bristles. It was the custom
to sacrifice this boar at the 'sacrifice of the herd.'
On Yule Eve the 'boar of the herd' was led into
the hall before the King. Then men laid their hands
on his bristles and made solemn vows. King Heithrek
himself made a vow that however deeply a man
should have wronged him, if he came into his power
he should not be deprived of the chance of receiving
a trial by the King's judges; but he should get
off scot free if he could propound riddles which the
King could not answer. But when people tried to
ask the King riddles, not one was put to him which
he could not solve.</p>

<p>The King sent a message to Gestumblindi bidding
him come to him on an appointed day; otherwise the
King said that he would send to fetch him. Neither
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page114" id="page114"></a>[pg 114]</span>
alternative pleased Gestumblindi, because he knew
himself to be no match for the King in a contest of
words; neither did he think he had much to hope from
a trial before the judges, for his offences were many.
On the other hand, he knew that if the King had to
send men to bring him it would cost him his life.
Then he proceeded to sacrifice to Othin and to ask
his help, promising him great offerings.</p>

<p>One evening a stranger visited Gestumblindi, and
said that he also was called Gestumblindi. They
were so much alike that neither could be distinguished
from the other. They exchanged clothes, and the
landowner went into hiding, and everyone thought
the stranger was the landowner himself.</p>

<p>This man went to visit the King and greeted him.
The King looked at him and was silent.</p>

<p>Gestumblindi said: "I am come, Sire, to make my
peace with you."</p>

<p>"Will you stand trial by the judges?" asked the
King.</p>

<p>"Are there no other means of escape?" asked
Gestumblindi.</p>

<p>"If," replied the King, "you can ask me riddles
which I cannot answer, you shall go free."</p>

<p>"I am not likely to be able to do that," replied
Gestumblindi; "yet the alternative is severe."</p>

<p>"Do you prefer the trial?" asked the King.</p>

<p>"Nay," said he, "I would rather ask riddles."</p>

<p>"That is quite in order," said the King, "and
much depends on the issue. If you can get the better
of me you shall marry my daughter and none shall
gainsay you. Yet I don't imagine you are very
clever, and it has never yet happened that I have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page115" id="page115"></a>[pg 115]</span>
been unable to solve the riddles that have been put
to me."</p>

<p>Then a chair was placed for Gestumblindi, and
the people began to listen eagerly to the words of
wisdom.</p>

<p class="indent">Gestumblindi began as follows:</p>

<a name="hh11" id="hh11"></a>
<blockquote><p>
XI.<a href="#nhh11">°</a> &nbsp;I would that I had that which I had yesterday. Guess
O King, what that was:&mdash;Exhauster of men, retarder of
words, yet originator of speech. King Heithrek, read me this
riddle!
</p></blockquote>

<p class="indent">Heithrek replied:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Your riddle is a good one, Gestumblindi. I have guessed it.&mdash;Give
him some ale. That is what confounds many people's
reason. Some are made garrulous by it, but some become
confused in their speech.
</p></blockquote>

<p class="indent">Gestumblindi said:</p>

<blockquote><p>
I went from home, I made my way from home, I looked
upon a road of roads. A road was beneath me, a road above
and a road on every side. King Heithrek, read me this
riddle!
</p></blockquote>

<p class="indent">Heithrek replied:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Your riddle is a good one, Gestumblindi. I have guessed it.
You went over a bridge, and the course of the river was
beneath it, and birds were flying over your head and on either
side of you; that was their road; you saw a salmon in the
river, and that was his road.
</p></blockquote>

<p class="indent">Gestumblindi said:</p>

<blockquote><p>
What was the drink that I had yesterday? It was neither
wine nor water, mead nor ale, nor any kind of food; and yet
I went away with my thirst quenched. King Heithrek, read
me this riddle!
</p></blockquote>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page116" id="page116"></a>[pg 116]</span>

<p class="indent">Heithrek replied:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Your riddle is a good one, Gestumblindi. I have guessed it.
You lay in the shade and cooled your lips in dew. But if you
are the Gestumblindi I took you for, you are a more
intelligent man than I expected; for I had heard that your
conversation showed no brains, yet now you are setting to work
cleverly.
</p></blockquote>

<p class="indent">Gestumblindi said:</p>

<blockquote><p>
I expect that I shall soon come to grief; yet I should like
you to listen a while longer.
</p></blockquote>

<p class="indent">Then he continued:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Who is that clanging one who traverses hard paths which
he has trod before? He kisses very rapidly, has two mouths
and walks on gold alone. King Heithrek, read me this riddle!
</p></blockquote>

<p class="indent">Heithrek replied:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Your riddle is a good one, Gestumblindi. I have guessed it.
That is the goldsmith's hammer, with which gold is forged.
</p></blockquote>

<p class="indent">Gestumblindi said:</p>

<blockquote><p>
What is that huge one that passes over the earth, swallowing
lakes and pools? He fears the wind, but he fears not man, and
carries on hostilities against the sun. King Heithrek, read me
this riddle!
</p></blockquote>

<p class="indent">Heithrek replied:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Your riddle is a good one, Gestumblindi. I have guessed it.
That is fog. One cannot see the sea because of it. Yet as soon
as the wind blows, the fog lifts; but men can do nothing to it.
Fog kills the sunshine. You have a cunning way of asking
riddles and conundrums, whoever you are.
</p></blockquote>

<p class="indent">Gestumblindi said:</p>

<blockquote><p>
What is that huge one that controls many things and of
which half faces towards Hell? It saves people's lives and
grapples with the earth, if it has a trusty friend. King
Heithrek, read me this riddle!
</p></blockquote>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page117" id="page117"></a>[pg 117]</span>

<p class="indent">Heithrek replied:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Your riddle is a good one, Gestumblindi. I have guessed it.
That is an anchor with its thick strong cable. It controls
many a ship, and grips the earth with one of its flukes which
is pointing towards Hell. It is a means of safety to many
people. Greatly do I marvel at your readiness of speech and
wisdom.
</p></blockquote>

<p class="indent">Gestumblindi said:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Ah, but I am now almost at the end of my riddles; yet
everyone is eager to save his life.&mdash;What lives in high
mountains? What falls in deep valleys? What lives without
breathing? What is never silent? King Heithrek, read me
this riddle!
</p></blockquote>

<p class="indent">Heithrek replied:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Your riddle is a good one, Gestumblindi. I have guessed it.
A raven always lives in high mountains, and dew falls in
deep valleys, a fish lives without breathing, and the booming
waterfall is never silent.</p>

<p>Things are now becoming serious, said Gestumblindi, and
I do not know what is going to happen.&mdash;What is the marvel
which I have seen outside Delling's doorway? It points its
head towards Hell and turns its feet to the sun. King Heithrek,
read me this riddle!
</p></blockquote>

<p class="indent">Heithrek replied:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Your riddle is a good one, Gestumblindi. I have guessed it.
That is a leek. Its head grows down into the ground, and its
blades upward into the air.
</p></blockquote>

<p class="indent">Gestumblindi said:</p>

<blockquote><p>
What is the marvel which I have seen outside Delling's
doorway?&mdash;Two restless, lifeless things boiling a wound-leek.
King Heithrek, read me this riddle!
</p></blockquote>

<p class="indent">Heithrek replied:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Your riddle is a good one, Gestumblindi. I have guessed it.
That is the smith's bellows which have breath, yet not life.
</p></blockquote>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page118" id="page118"></a>[pg 118]</span>

<p class="indent">Gestumblindi said:</p>

burying themselves in sand! King Heithrek, read me this

</p></blockquote>

<p class="indent">Heithrek replied:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Your riddle is a good one, Gestumblindi. I have guessed it.
But now your riddles are growing trivial. That is hail and
rain; for hail beats upon the street; whereas rain-drops fall
into the sand and sink into the earth.
</p></blockquote>

<p class="indent">Gestumblindi said:</p>

<blockquote><p>
What is the marvel which I have seen outside Delling's
doorway? I saw a black hog wallowing in mud, yet no
bristles were standing up on his back. King Heithrek, read

</p></blockquote>

<p class="indent">Heithrek replied:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Your riddle is a good one, Gestumblindi. I have guessed it.
That is a dung-beetle. But we have talked too long when
dung-beetles come to exercise the wits of great men.
</p></blockquote>

<p class="indent">Gestumblindi said:</p>

<blockquote><p>
"It is best to put off misfortune"; and though there are
some who overlook this truth, many will want to go on trying.
I myself too see now that I shall have to look out for every
possible way of escape. What is the marvel that I have seen
outside Delling's doorway? This creature has ten tongues,
twenty eyes, forty feet, and walks with difficulty. King
Heithrek, read me this riddle!
</p></blockquote>

<p class="indent">Heithrek replied:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Your riddle is a good one, Gestumblindi. I have guessed it.
That was a sow with nine little pigs.
</p></blockquote>

<p>Then the King had the sow killed and they found
they had killed with her nine little pigs, as Gestumblindi
had said.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page119" id="page119"></a>[pg 119]</span>

<p class="indent">Then the King said:</p>

<blockquote><p>
I am beginning to suspect that I have to deal with a
cleverer man than myself in this business; but I don't know
who you can be.
</p></blockquote>

<p class="indent">Gestumblindi said:</p>

<blockquote><p>
I am such as you can see; and I am very anxious to save
my life and be quit of this task.</p>

<p>You must go on asking riddles, replied the King, till you
have exhausted your stock, or else till I fail to solve them.
</p></blockquote>

<p class="indent">Gestumblindi said:</p>

<blockquote><p>
What is the marvel which I have seen outside Delling's
doorway? It flies high, with a whistling sound like the
whirring of an eagle. Hard it is to clutch, O King. King

</p></blockquote>

<p class="indent">Heithrek replied:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Your riddle is a good one, Gestumblindi. I have guessed it.
That is an arrow, said the King.
</p></blockquote>

<p class="indent">Gestumblindi said:</p>

<blockquote><p>
What is the marvel which I have seen outside Delling's
doorway? It has eight feet and four eyes, and carries its knees
higher than its body. King Heithrek, read me this riddle!

<p class="indent">Heithrek replied:</p>

<blockquote><p>
I notice firstly that you have a long hood; and secondly
that you look downwards more than most people, since you
observe every creature of the earth.&mdash;That is a spider.
</p></blockquote>

<p class="indent">Gestumblindi said:</p>

<blockquote><p>
What is the marvel which I have seen outside Delling's
doorway? It shines upon men in every land; and yet wolves
are always struggling for it. King Heithrek, read me this

</p></blockquote>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page120" id="page120"></a>[pg 120]</span>

<p class="indent">Heithrek replied:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Your riddle is a good one, Gestumblindi. I have guessed it.
It is the sun. It gives light to every land and shines down on
all men. But the wolves are called Skalli and Hatti. Those
are the wolves who accompany the sun, one in front and one
behind.
</p></blockquote>

<p class="indent">Gestumblindi said:</p>

<blockquote><p>
What is the marvel which I have seen outside Delling's
doorway? It was harder than horn, blacker than the raven,
whiter than the membrane of an egg, straighter than a shaft.
King Heithrek, read me this riddle!
</p></blockquote>

<p class="indent">Heithrek replied:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Your riddle is a good one, Gestumblindi. I have guessed it.
You saw an agate, and a sunbeam penetrated the house and
shone upon it. But since you seem to be a learned man, can
you not propound your riddles without always beginning
them in the same way?
</p></blockquote>

<p class="indent">Then said Gestumblindi:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Two bond-women, fair-haired brides, were carrying ale
to the store-room. The cask was not turned by hands, nor
clinched by hammers; and he who made it strutted about
outside the islands. King Heithrek, read me this riddle!
</p></blockquote>

<p class="indent">Heithrek replied:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Your riddle is a good one, Gestumblindi. I have guessed it.
These are eider duck laying their eggs. The eggs are not
made with hammer or hands, and the hand-maidens put the
ale into the egg-shell.
</p></blockquote>

<p class="indent">Gestumblindi said:</p>

<blockquote><p>
He who has got but a little sword and is very short of
learning has to look out for help. I would like to talk still
further.&mdash;Who are those ladies of the lofty mountain? A
woman begets by a woman; a maid has a son by a maid; and
these good-wives have no husbands. King Heithrek, read me

</p></blockquote>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page121" id="page121"></a>[pg 121]</span>

<p class="indent">Heithrek replied:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Your riddle is a good one, Gestumblindi. I have guessed
it. They are two Angelicas joined together, and a young
angelica shoot is growing between them.
</p></blockquote>

<p class="indent">Gestumblindi said:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Who are the girls who fight without weapons around their
lord? The dark red ones always protect him, and the fair ones
seek to destroy him. King Heithrek, read me this riddle!
</p></blockquote>

<p class="indent">Heithrek replied:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Your riddle is a good one, Gestumblindi. I have guessed it.
That is a game of chess. The pieces smite one another without
weapons around the king, and the red assist him.
</p></blockquote>

<p class="indent">Gestumblindi said:</p>

Who are the merry-maids who glide over the land for their
father's pleasure? They bear a white shield in winter and a

<p class="indent">Gestumblindi said:</p>

<blockquote><p>
I am loath to do so; and yet I fear that it will very soon

</p></blockquote>

<p class="indent">Heithrek replied:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Your riddle is a good one, Gestumblindi. I have guessed it.
It is that you came to a river; and an ice-floe was floating
along the stream, and on it a dead horse was lying, and on the
horse was a dead snake; and thus the blind was carrying the
blind when they were all three together.

<p class="indent">Gestumblindi said:</p>

<blockquote><p>
I sat on a sail, and saw dead men carrying a channel of
blood in the bark of a tree. King Heithrek, read me this
riddle!
</p></blockquote>

<p class="indent">Heithrek replied:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Your riddle is a good one, Gestumblindi. I have guessed it.
You sat on a wall, and watched a hawk flying and carrying
an eider duck in its claws.
</p></blockquote>

<p class="indent">Gestumblindi said:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Who are those two who have ten feet, three eyes and one
tail? King Heithrek, read me this riddle!
</p></blockquote>

<p class="indent">Heithrek replied:</p>

<blockquote><p>
You are hard up when you have to turn back to things of
long ago to bring forward against me. That is Othin riding
his horse Sleipnir. It had eight feet and Othin two, and they
had three eyes&mdash;Sleipnir two and Othin one.
</p></blockquote>

<p class="indent">Gestumblindi said:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Tell me lastly, Heithrek, if you are wiser than any other
prince, what did Othin whisper in Balder's ear, before he
was placed upon the pyre?
</p></blockquote>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page126" id="page126"></a>[pg 126]</span>

<p class="indent">The King replied:</p>

<blockquote><p>
I am sure it was something scandalous and cowardly and
thoroughly contemptible. You are the only person who knows
the words which you spoke, you evil and wretched creature.
</p></blockquote>

<p>Then the King drew Tyrfing, and struck at
Gestumblindi; but he changed himself into a falcon
and flew out through the window of the hall. And
the sword struck the tail of the falcon; and that is
why it has had a short tail ever since, according to
heathen superstition. But Othin had now become
wroth with the King for striking at him; and that
night he was slain.</p>

<a name="hh12" id="hh12"></a>
<p class="indent">XII.<a href="#nhh12">°</a> &nbsp;It is said that King Heithrek had some slaves,
nine in all, whom he had taken in a freebooting
expedition in the West. They came of noble families,
and chafed against their captivity. One night, when
King Heithrek lay in bed, attended by only a handful
of men, the slaves armed themselves and went to the
building in which he lay. They first slew the sentries,
and then went and broke into the King's chamber,
and slew the King and all who were within. They took
the sword Tyrfing, and all the treasure that they
found there, and carried everything off with them.</p>

<p>For a while, no one knew who had done the deed
or how vengeance was to be taken. Then Angantyr
the son of King Heithrek had a meeting called, and
by that assembly he was proclaimed King over all
the territories that King Heithrek had held. And
at the same meeting he swore a solemn oath that he
would never sit on his father's throne until he had
avenged him.</p>

<p>Shortly after the meeting, Angantyr went away by
himself and travelled far and wide searching for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page127" id="page127"></a>[pg 127]</span>
these men. One evening he was walking down to the
sea along a river called Graf. There he saw three men
in a fishing-boat, and presently he saw one of the
men catch a fish, and heard him call to one of his
companions to hand him a bait-knife to cut off the
fish's head. The man replied that he could not spare
it. Then the first man said:</p>

<p>"Take down the sword from over there by the
rudder, and hand it to me."</p>

<p>And he took it and unsheathed it, and cut off the
fish's head, and then spoke a verse:</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>This pike at the mouth of the river</p>
<p class="i2">Has paid the penalty</p>
<p>For the slaughter inflicted on Heithrek,</p>
<p class="i2">'Neath the Mountains of Harvathi.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Angantyr immediately perceived that it was
Tyrfing, and went off at once to the wood and waited
there till it was dark. And the fishermen rowed to
the land, and went to a tent which they had, and lay
down and went to sleep. And when it was close on
midnight, Angantyr went up to them and pulled
down the tent on top of the slaves and slew all nine
of them, and carried off the sword Tyrfing as a sign
that he had avenged his father. He then went home
and had a great funeral feast held to his father's
memory on the banks of the Dnieper, at a place called
Arheimar. The kings who ruled at that time were as
follows: Humli ruled the Huns, Gizur the Gautar,
Angantyr the Goths, Valdar the Danes, Kjar the
Gauls; Alrek the Bold ruled the English people.</p>

<p>Hlöth the son of King Heithrek was brought up
at the court of King Humli, his grandfather. He
was a very handsome and valiant man. There was an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page128" id="page128"></a>[pg 128]</span>
old saying at that time that a man was "born with
weapons or horses." And the explanation is that it
referred to the weapons which were being forged at
the time when the man was born; also to any sheep,
beasts, oxen and horses that were born about the
same time. These were all given to high-born men
as an honour to them, as is here related about Hlöth
the son of Heithrek:</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>In the land of the Huns was Hölth born</p>
<p class="i2">In a holy forest glade,</p>
<p>With ring-bedizened helmet,</p>
<p class="i2">With dagger and keen-edged blade,</p>
<p>With byrnie and with broadsword,</p>
<p class="i2">And noble prancing steed.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Then Hlöth learnt of the death of his father, and
also that his brother Angantyr had been made King
over all the territory which their father had held.
Then King Humli and Hlöth resolved that Hlöth
should go and request his brother Angantyr to allow
him a share of his father's property, and that he
should try first by fair words&mdash;as is said here:</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Hlöth, the heir of Heithrek,</p>
<p class="i2">Came riding from the East,</p>
<p>To where Angantyr was holding</p>
<p class="i2">King Heithrek's funeral feast.</p>
<p>He came to his court in Arheimar</p>
<p class="i2">Where the Gothic people dwell,</p>
<p>Demanding his share of the heritage left</p>
<p class="i2">By the King when he journeyed to Hell.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Hlöth now arrived in Arheimar with a great host
as it says here:</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>He found a warrior hastening</p>
<p class="i2">Towards the lofty hall;</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page129" id="page129"></a>[pg 129]</span>
<p>And unto this late traveller</p>
<p class="i2">Did Hlöth his greeting call:</p>
<p>O man, make haste to enter</p>
<p class="i2">This hall that towers so high!</p>
<p class="i4">Bid Angantyr speed,</p>
<p class="i4">For great is the need</p>
<p class="i2">We hold a colloquy.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>The men entered and went up to Angantyr's table
and saluted the King, saying:</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Hlöth, thy warlike brother,</p>
<p class="i2">King Heithrek's valiant heir,</p>
<p>Has sent me hither to thee,</p>
<p class="i2">And bidden me declare</p>
<p>That he wishes to hold converse;</p>
<p class="i2">And though he be young indeed,</p>
<p>Yet he looks a mighty champion,</p>
<p class="i2">Seated high upon his steed.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>And when the King heard that, he flung down his
knife upon the table and arose from the feast; and
he put on his corslet and took a white shield in one
hand and the sword Tyrfing in the other. Then a
great din arose in the hall, as is said in the poem:</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Then a murmur arose from the warriors,</p>
<p class="i2">And all in the hall drew near,</p>
<p>As the warder reported the message of Hlöth:</p>
<p class="i2">&mdash;Everyone lent an ear;</p>
<p>And the men all awaited with quivering breath</p>
<p class="i2">The message of Angantyr.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Then Angantyr said: "Hail, brother! You are
welcome! Come in and drink with us, and let us
first drink mead in memory of our father, to the
honour and glory of us all with full ceremony."</p>

<p>Hlöth said: "We are come hither for a different
purpose than to fill our stomachs."</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page130" id="page130"></a>[pg 130]</span>

<p class="ind1">Then Hlöth cried:</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Of all the possessions of Heithrek</p>
<p class="i2">The half do I now demand;</p>
<p>&mdash;His spear and blade and treasures,</p>
<p class="i2">His cattle and his land,</p>
<p>His handmaids and his bondmen,</p>

<p>Half of the noble pillar</p>

<p>And of Heithrek's castles, land and folk,</p>
<p class="i2">And half of his golden store!</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p class="ind1">Cried Angantyr:</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">

<p>Ere I give thee half my heritage,</p>
<p class="i2">Or half of the sword Tyrfing.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p class="ind1">But Angantyr added:</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">

  <a name="hh13" id="hh13"></a>
<p class="indent">XIII.<a href="#nhh13">°</a> &nbsp;Gizur, a liegeman from the Grytingar,
King Heithrek's foster-father, was with King
Angantyr. He was a very old man at that time. And
when he heard King Angantyr's suggestion, he
thought that he was offering too much and said:</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>King Angantyr is generous,</p>
<p class="i2">And royal his offering!</p>
<p>For thy mother was merely a bondmaid</p>
<p class="i2">Though thou hadst for thy father a King.</p>
<p>And though thou art only an outcast,</p>
<p class="i2">Yet a seat of honour was thine,</p>
<p>When the Prince was dividing his treasure and land,</p>
<p class="i2">And his portion to each did assign.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Hlöth grew very angry at being called an outcast
and the child of a bondwoman, if he accepted
his brother's offer; so he departed at once with all
his men and returned home to King Humli, his
mother's father, in the land of the Huns. And he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page132" id="page132"></a>[pg 132]</span>
told Humli that Angantyr his brother had not
granted him an equal share. King Humli enquired
as to all that had passed between them, and was very
angry that Hlöth, the son of his daughter, should be
called the son of a bondmaid, and he cried:</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>We will stay in our homes for the winter,</p>
<p class="i2">And as princes are wont when they dine,</p>
<p>We will hold high converse together,</p>
<p class="i2">Quaffing the costly wine.</p>
<p>We will call on the Hunnish people</p>
<p class="i2">To arm them with spear and with shield.&mdash;</p>
<p class="i4">They shall march to the fight</p>
<p class="i4">Right royally dight,</p>
<p class="i2">And conquer their foes in the field.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p class="ind1">Then he added:</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>We will summon a mighty host, Hlöth,</p>
<p class="i2">And shield on shield will clang,</p>
<p>As the warriors arm them from twelve years old,</p>
<p class="i2">And the wild colts gallop along.</p>
<p class="i4">And the Huns shall mass</p>
<p class="i4">Ere the winter pass,</p>
<p class="i2">And assemble a countless throng.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>That winter, King Humli and Hlöth remained
quiet, but the following spring they collected such
a large army that the land of the Huns was swept
bare of fighting men. All those of twelve years old
and upwards, who were fit for military service and
could carry arms, joined the army, and all the horses
of two years old and upwards. The host was now so
big that thousands and nothing less than thousands
could be counted in the legions. And a commander
was set over every 'thousand,' and a standard was set
up over every legion. And there were five 'thousand'
in each legion, each 'thousand' containing thirteen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page133" id="page133"></a>[pg 133]</span>
'hundreds,' and each 'hundred' four times forty men;
and these legions were thirty three in number.</p>

<p>When these troops had assembled, they rode
through the forest which was called Myrkvith, and
which separated the land of the Huns from that of
the Goths. And when they emerged from the forest,
they came upon a thickly inhabited country with
level fields; and on these plains there was a fine
fortress. It was under the command of Hervör, the
sister of Angantyr and Hlöth, and Ormar, her foster-father
was with her. They had been appointed to
defend the land against the Hunnish host, and they
had a large army there.</p>

<a name="hh14" id="hh14"></a>
<p class="indent">XIV.<a href="#nhh14">°</a> &nbsp;It happened one morning at sunrise that as
Hervör was standing on the summit of a tower over
the gate of the fortress, she looked southwards towards
the forest, and saw clouds of dust arising from
a great body of horse, by which the sun was hidden
for a long time. Next she saw a gleam beneath the
dust, as though she were gazing on a mass of gold&mdash;fair
shields overlaid with gold, gilded helmets and
white corslets. Then she perceived that it was the
Hunnish host coming on in vast numbers. She
descended hastily and called her trumpeter, and bade
him sound the assembly.</p>

<p>Then said Hervör: "Take your weapons and arm
for battle; and do thou, Ormar, ride against the
Huns and offer them battle before the Southern
Gate."</p>

<p>Ormar replied: "I will certainly take my shield
and ride with the companies of the Goths. I will
challenge the Huns and offer them battle before the
Southern Gate."</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page134" id="page134"></a>[pg 134]</span>

<p>Then Ormar rode out of the fortress against the
Huns. He called loudly bidding them ride up to the
fort, saying:</p>

<p>"Outside the gate of the fortress, in the plains to
the south&mdash;there will I offer you battle. Let those
who arrive first await their foes!"</p>

<p>Then Ormar rode back to the fortress, and found
Hervör and all her host armed and ready. They rode
forthwith out of the fort with all their host against
the Huns, and a great battle began between them.
But the Hunnish host was far superior in numbers,
so that Hervör's troops began to suffer heavy losses;
and in the end Hervör fell, and a great part of her
army round about her. And when Ormar saw her
fall, he fled with all those who still survived. Ormar
rode day and night as fast as he could to King
Angantyr in Arheimar. The Huns then proceeded
to ravage and burn throughout the land.</p>

<p>And when Ormar came into the presence of King
Angantyr, he cried:</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>From the south have I journeyed hither</p>
<p class="i2">To bear these tidings to thee:&mdash;</p>
<p>The whole of the forest of Myrkvith</p>
<p class="i2">Is burnt up utterly;</p>
<p>And the land of the Goths is drenched with blood</p>
<p class="i2">As our warriors fall and die.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p class="ind1">Then he continued:</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>All of thy noblest warriors</p>
<p class="i2">On the field are lying dead.</p>
<p>King Heithrek's daughter fell by the sword;</p>
<p class="i2">She drooped and bowed her head.</p>
<p>Thy sister Hervör is now no more.&mdash;</p>
<p class="i2">By the Huns was her life-blood shed.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page135" id="page135"></a>[pg 135]</span>
<p>O prouder and lighter the maiden's step</p>
<p class="i2">As she wielded spear and sword</p>
<p>Than if she were sped to her trysting place,</p>
<p class="i2">Or her seat at the bridal-board!</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>When King Angantyr heard that, he drew back
his lips, and it was some time before he spoke. Then
he said:</p>

<p>"In no brotherly wise hast thou been treated, my
noble sister!"</p>

<p>Then he surveyed his retinue, and his band of
men was but small; then he cried:</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>The Gothic warriors were many,</p>
<p class="i2">As they sat and drank the mead;</p>
<p>But now when many are called for,</p>
<p class="i2">The array is poor indeed!</p>
<p>Not a man in the host will adventure&mdash;</p>
<p class="i2">Though I offer a rich reward&mdash;</p>
<p class="i4">To take his shield,</p>
<p class="i4">And ride to the field,</p>
<p class="i2">To seek out the Hunnish horde.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p class="ind1">Then Gizur the Old cried:</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>I will crave no single farthing,</p>
<p class="i2">Nor ringing coin of gold;</p>
<p class="i4">I will take my shield</p>
<p class="i4">And ride to the field</p>
<p class="i2">To the Huns with their myriads untold.</p>
<p>And the message of war that you send to the host</p>
<p class="i2">Will I carry, and there unfold.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>It was a rule with King Heithrek that if his
army was invading a land, and the King of that
land had set up hazel stakes to mark the spot on
which the battle was to take place, then the vikings
should not go raiding till the battle had been fought.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page136" id="page136"></a>[pg 136]</span>

<p>Gizur armed himself with good weapons and
leapt on his horse as if he had been a young man. Then
he cried to the King:</p>

<p>"Where shall I challenge the host of the Huns to
battle?"</p>

<p>King Angantyr replied: "Challenge them to
battle at Dylgia and on Dunheith, and upon all
the heights of Jösur, where the Goths have often
won renown by glorious victories!"</p>

<p>Then Gizur rode away until he came to the host
of the Huns. He rode just within earshot, and then
called loudly, crying:</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Your host is panic stricken,</p>
<p class="i2">And your prince is doomed to fall;</p>
<p>Though your banners are waving high in the air,</p>
<p class="i2">Yet Othin is wroth with you all.</p>
<p>Come forth to the Jösur Mountains,</p>
<p class="i2">On Dylgia and Dunheith come fight;</p>
<p class="i4">For I make a sure boast,</p>
<p class="i4">In the heart of your host</p>
<p class="i2">The javelin of Othin will light!</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>When Hlöth heard Gizur's words, he cried:</p>

<p>"Lay hold upon Gizur of the Grytingar, Angantyr's
man, who has come from Arheimar!"</p>

<p>King Humli said: "We must not injure heralds
who travel about unattended."</p>

<p>Gizur cried: "You Hunnish dogs are not going
to overcome us with guile."</p>

<p>Then Gizur struck spurs into his horse and rode
back to King Angantyr, and went up to him and
saluted him. The King asked him if he had parleyed
with the Huns.</p>

<p>Gizur replied: "I spoke with them and I challenged
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page137" id="page137"></a>[pg 137]</span>
them to meet us on the battle-field of Dunheith
and in the valleys of Dylgia."</p>

<p>Angantyr asked how big the army of the Huns was.</p>

<p>"Their host is very numerous," replied Gizur.
"There are six legions in all, and five 'thousands' in
every legion, and each 'thousand' contains thirteen
'hundreds,' and in every 'hundred' there are a
hundred and sixty men."</p>

<p>Angantyr asked further questions about the host
of the Huns.</p>

<p>He then sent men in all directions to summon every
man who was willing to support him and could bear
weapons. He then marched to Dunheith with his
army, and it was a very great host. There the host
of the Huns came against him with an army half as
big again as his own.</p>

<a name="hh15" id="hh15"></a>
<p class="indent">XV.<a href="#nhh15">°</a> &nbsp;Next day they began their battle, and they
fought together the whole day, and at evening they
went to their quarters. They continued fighting for
eight days, but the princes were then still all unwounded,
though none could count the number of
the slain. But both day and night troops came
thronging round Angantyr's banner from all quarters;
and so it came about that his army never grew
less.</p>

<p>The battle now became fiercer than ever. The
Huns were desperate, for they now saw that their
only chance of escaping annihilation lay in victory,
and that sorry would be their lot if they had to ask
for quarter from the Goths. The Goths on the other
hand were defending their freedom and their native
land against the Huns; so they stood fast and encouraged
one another to fight on. Then towards the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page138" id="page138"></a>[pg 138]</span>
close of the day the Goths made so fierce an attack
that the line of the Huns recoiled before it. And when
Angantyr saw that, he pressed forward from behind
the rampart of shields into the forefront of the battle
and grasping Tyrfing in his hand, mowed down both
men and horses. Then the ranks fell apart in front
of the Kings of the Huns, and Hlöth exchanged
blows with his brother. There fell Hlöth and King
Humli, and then the Huns took to flight. The Goths
cut them down and made such a great slaughter that
the rivers were dammed with the bodies and diverted
from their courses, and the valleys were full of dead
men and horses. Angantyr then went to search
among the slain, and found his brother Hlöth. Then
he cried:</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>I offered thee wealth unstinted, brother,</p>
<p class="i2">And treasures manifold,&mdash;</p>
<p>Riches of cattle and land, brother,</p>

<p class="indent">XVI.<a href="#nhh16">°</a> &nbsp;Angantyr ruled Reithgotaland as King for
a long time. He was powerful and generous and
a great warrior, and lines of kings are sprung from
him.</p>

<p>He had a son called Heithrek Wolfskin who ruled
after him for a long time in Reithgotaland. Heithrek
had a daughter called Hild, who was the mother of
Halfdan the Valiant, the father of Ivar Vithfathmi.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page139" id="page139"></a>[pg 139]</span>
Ivar Vithfathmi went with his army into the Swedish
kingdom, as is told in the Sagas of the Kings. And
King Ingjald the Wicked was panic-stricken at the
approach of his army, and burned the roof over himself
and all his retinue at a place called Ræning. Ivar
Vithfathmi then conquered all Sweden. He also subdued
Denmark and Courland and the land of the
Saxons and Esthonia, and all the eastern realms as
far as Russia. He also ruled the land of the Saxons
in the West and conquered the part of England
which was called Northumbria.</p>

<p>Then he conquered all Denmark and set over it
King Valdar, to whom he married his daughter
Alfhild. Their sons were Harold Hilditönn and
Randver who afterwards fell in England. And when
Valdar died in Denmark, Randver got possession of
the Danish kingdom and made himself King over it.
And King Harold Hilditönn got himself proclaimed
King of Gautland, and he afterwards conquered all
the kingdoms already mentioned, which King Ivar
Vithfathmi had held.</p>

<p>King Randver married Asa, the daughter of
King Harold of the Red Moustache from Norway.
Their son was Sigurth Hring. King Randver died
suddenly, and Sigurth Hring succeeded to the
Kingdom of Denmark. He fought against King
Harold Hilditönn at the Battle of Bravöll in East
Gautland, and there King Harold fell, and a great
multitude of his army with him. This battle and the
one which Angantyr and his brother Hlöth fought
at Dunheith are the battles which have been most
famous in stories of old. Never were any greater
slaughters made.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page140" id="page140"></a>[pg 140]</span>

<p>King Sigurth Hring ruled the Kingdom of the
Danes till the day of his death; and his son Ragnar
Lothbrok succeeded him.</p>

<p>Harold Hilditönn had a son called Eystein the
Wicked, who succeeded to the Swedish Realm after
his father, and ruled it until he was slain by the sons
of Ragnar Lothbrok, as is related in the Saga of
Ragnar Lothbrok. The sons of Ragnar Lothbrok
conquered all the Swedish Kingdom; and after the
death of King Ragnar, his son, Björn Ironside, inherited
Sweden, and Sigurth Denmark, Hvitserk the
Eastern Realm, and Ivar the Boneless England.</p>

<p>The sons of Björn Ironside were Eric and Refil.
The latter was a warrior-prince and sea-king. King
Eric ruled the Swedish Realm after his father, and
lived but a short time. Then Eric the son of Refil
succeeded to the Kingdom. He was a great warrior
and a very powerful King. The sons of Eric Björnsson
were Önund of Upsala and King Björn. Then the
Swedish Realm again came to be divided between
brothers. They succeeded to the Kingdom on the
death of Eric Refilsson. King Björn built a house
called 'Barrow,' and he himself was called Björn
of the Barrow. Bragi the poet was with him. King
Önund had a son called Eric, and he succeeded to
the throne at Upsala after his father. He was a
mighty King. In his days Harold the Fair-haired
made himself King of Norway. He was the first to
unite the whole of that country under his sway.</p>

<p>Eric at Upsala had a son called Björn, who came
to the throne after his father and ruled for a long
time. The sons of Björn, Eric the Victorious, and
Olaf succeeded to the kingdom after their father.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page141" id="page141"></a>[pg 141]</span>
Olaf was the father of Styrbjörn the Strong. In their
days King Harold the Fair-haired died. Styrbjörn
fought against King Eric his father's brother at
Fyrisvellir, and there Styrbjörn fell. Then Eric ruled
Sweden till the day of his death. He married Sigrith
the Ambitious. They had a son called Olaf who was
accepted as King in Sweden after King Eric. He
was only a child at the time and the Swedes carried
him about with them, and for this reason they called
him 'Skirt-King,' and then, later, Olaf the Swede.
He ruled for a long time and was a powerful King.
He was the first king of Sweden to be converted, and
in his days, Sweden was nominally Christian.</p>

<p>King Olaf the Swede had a son called Önund who
succeeded him. He died in his bed. In his day fell
King Olaf the Saint at Stiklestad. Olaf the Swede
had another son called Eymund, who came to the
throne after his brother. In his day the Swedes
neglected the Christian religion, but he was King
for only a short time.</p>

<p>There was a great man of noble family in Sweden
called Steinkel. His mother's name was Astrith,
the daughter of Njal the son of Fin the Squinter, from
Halogaland; and his father was Rögnvald the Old.
Steinkel was an Earl in Sweden at first, and then
after the death of Eymund, the Swedes elected him
their King. Then the throne passed out of the line
of the ancient kings of Sweden. Steinkel was a
mighty prince. He married the daughter of King
Eymund. He died in his bed in Sweden about the
time that King Harold fell in England.</p>

<p>Steinkel had a son called Ingi, who became King
of Sweden after Haakon. Ingi was King of Sweden
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page142" id="page142"></a>[pg 142]</span>
for a long time, and was popular and a good Christian.
He tried to put an end to heathen sacrifices in
Sweden and commanded all the people to accept
Christianity; yet the Swedes held to their ancient
faith. King Ingi married a woman called Mær who
had a brother called Svein. King Ingi liked Svein
better than any other man, and Svein became thereby
the greatest man in Sweden. The Swedes considered
that King Ingi was violating the ancient law of the
land when he took exception to many things which
Steinkel his father had permitted, and at an assembly
held between the Swedes and King Ingi, they offered
him two alternatives, either to follow the old order,
or else to abdicate. Then King Ingi spoke up and
said that he would not abandon the true faith;
whereupon the Swedes raised a shout and pelted
him with stones, and drove him from the assembly.</p>

<p>Svein, the King's brother-in-law, remained behind
in the assembly, and offered the Swedes to do sacrifices
on their behalf if they would give him the Kingdom.
They all agreed to accept Svein's offer, and he was
then recognised as King over all Sweden. A horse
was then brought to the assembly and hewn in pieces
and cut up for eating, and the sacred tree was smeared
with blood. Then all the Swedes abandoned Christianity,
and sacrifices were started again. They drove
King Ingi away; and he went into Vestergötland.
Svein the Sacrificer was King of Sweden for three
years.</p>

<p>King Ingi set off with his retinue and some of his
followers, though it was but a small force. He then
rode eastwards by Småland and into Östergötland
and then into Sweden. He rode both day and night,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page143" id="page143"></a>[pg 143]</span>
and came upon Svein suddenly in the early morning.
They caught him in his house and set it on fire and
burned the band of men who were within.</p>

<p>There was a baron called Thjof who was burnt
inside. He had been previously in the retinue of
Svein the Sacrificer. Svein himself left the house, but
was slain immediately.</p>

<p>Thus Ingi once more received the Kingdom of
Sweden; and he reestablished Christianity and ruled
the Kingdom till the end of his life, when he died
in his bed.</p>

<p>King Steinkel had, besides Ingi, another son
Hallstein who reigned along with his brother.
Hallstein's sons were Philip and Ingi, and they
succeeded to the Kingdom of Sweden after King
Ingi the elder. Philip married Ingigerth, the daughter
of King Harold the son of Sigurth. He reigned for
only a short time.</p>

<h3 style="margin-top: 3em;">APPENDIX TO PART I</h3>

<h3>THE COMBAT AT SAMSØ AND HJALMAR'S DEATH SONG</h3>

<p>The following passage is taken from an early text
of the <i>Saga of Hervör and Heithrek</i> (<span class="sc">ms</span>. 2845 in the
Royal Library at Copenhagen) where it occurs
immediately after the earl's speech ("The death of
mighty men" etc.) on p. 92<a id="footnotetaga1" name="footnotetaga1"></a><a href="#footnotea1"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>

<p>When the brothers came home they made ready
to go to the combat, and their father accompanied
them to the ship and gave the sword Tyrfing to
Angantyr, saying:</p>

<p>"I think that you will have need of good weapons
now."</p>

<p>He then bade them farewell, and so they parted.</p>

<p>And when the brothers came to Samsø they saw
two ships lying in a harbour which was called Munarvag.
The ships were of the kind called 'Ash.' The
brothers concluded that these must be the ships of
Hjalmar and Odd the Far-travelling, who was called
Örvar-Odd. The sons of Arngrim then drew their
swords and gnawed the rims of their shields and
worked themselves up into the berserks' fury. Then
they sallied forth, six against each 'Ash,' but so
brave were the men whom they encountered on board
that they all drew their weapons, and not one fled
from his post, and not one spoke a word of fear. And
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page145" id="page145"></a>[pg 145]</span>
the berserks made their way up one side of the ship
and down the other and slew them all. Then they
landed and began to howl.</p>

<p>Hjalmar and Odd had landed on the Island to find
out if the berserks had come. And as they made their
way from the forest to join their ships, the berserks
were leaving the ships with bloody weapons and
drawn swords. But by this time the berserk fury
had passed away from them, and at such times their
strength is reduced like that of people who are
recovering from illness of some kind.</p>

<p class="ind1">Then said Odd:</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>I never knew aught of terror</p>
<p class="i2">Till today when the berserks came.</p>
<p>They have sailed to this isle in their ashen ships,</p>
<p class="i2">All twelve devoid of shame,</p>
<p>And landed with many a whoop and yell,</p>
<p class="i2">Those wretches of evil fame.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Then said Hjalmar to Odd: "Do you see that all
our men are fallen? It is my belief that we shall all
be Othin's guests tonight in Valhalla."</p>

<p>&mdash;And it is said that that was the only word of
fear ever uttered by Hjalmar.</p>

<p>Odd replied: "My advice would be that we should
make off to the wood; for we shall never be able to put
up a fight, being only two against twelve&mdash;and twelve
too who have slain the twelve bravest men in Sweden."</p>

<p>Then said Hjalmar: "We will never flee from our
foes. Rather will we suffer the worst that their weapons
can inflict. I am going to fight against the berserks."</p>

<p>"Not so," replied Odd; "I have no mind to visit
Othin tonight. It is all these berserks who must perish
before evening comes; but you and I will be left alive."</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page146" id="page146"></a>[pg 146]</span>

<p>An account of their dialogue is found in these
verses which Hjalmar chanted:</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Twelve berserks hasten onward,</p>
<p class="i2">Inglorious warriors;&mdash;</p>
<p>Leaving their warships on they come;</p>
<p class="i2">And when night's shadow lowers</p>
<p>We two shall feast in Othin's hall,</p>
<p class="i2">Leaving them conquerors.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p class="ind1">But Odd replied:</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>This is the answer I give thee:&mdash;</p>
<p class="i2">In Othin's hall tonight,</p>
<p class="i4">Twelve berserks shall feast,</p>
<p class="i4">Every one as a guest,</p>
<p>While we shall live on in the light.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Hjalmar and Odd saw that Angantyr had Tyrfing
in his hand, for it flashed like a sunbeam.</p>

<p>Hjalmar said: "Will you fight against Angantyr
alone, or against all his eleven brothers?"</p>

<p>"I will fight against Angantyr," replied Odd; "He
will give mighty strokes with Tyrfing; but I have
more faith in the protection of my shirt than in that
of your mail-coat."</p>

<p>Then cried Hjalmar: "When did you and I ever
go to battle and you took the lead of me? You want
to fight Angantyr because you hold that to be the
deed of greater prowess. I am the leader in this
combat, however, and far other was the vow I made
to the daughter of the King of the Swedes than to let
you or anybody else come before me in the fight.
It is I who am going to fight Angantyr."</p>

<p>And with that he drew his sword and stepped
forth to meet Angantyr and they commended one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page147" id="page147"></a>[pg 147]</span>
another to Valhalla<a id="footnotetaga2" name="footnotetaga2"></a><a href="#footnotea2"><sup>2</sup></a>. Hjalmar and Angantyr then
made ready for the combat, and mighty strokes fell
thick and fast between them.</p>

<p class="ind1">Odd called to the berserks, saying:</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Man to man should a warrior fight</p>
<p class="i2">Who would win a well-fought day,&mdash;</p>
<p>Unless it be that his courage fail,</p>
<p class="i2">Or his valour has ebbed away.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Then Hjörvarth advanced, and he and Odd had a
stiff encounter; but Odd's silken shirt was so strong
that no weapon could pierce it. And so good was his
sword that it cut through iron as easily as cloth; and
few strokes had he dealt ere Hjörvarth fell dead.</p>

<p>Then Hervarth came on and the same thing
happened;&mdash;then Hrani, then each of the others in
turn. And with such force did Odd encounter them
all that he slew every one of the eleven brothers. As
for the combat between Hjalmar and Angantyr, the
upshot was that Hjalmar was wounded in sixteen
places, and then Angantyr fell dead.</p>

<p class="ind1">Then Odd went over to where Hjalmar lay and
cried:</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>O Hjalmar! Why has thy face grown pale</p>
<p class="i2">As the face of men who die?</p>
<p>Wide gape the rents in byrnie and helm,</p>
<p class="i2">And I fear that the end draws nigh;</p>
<p>And the strength of manhood has gone from thine arm,</p>
<p class="i2">And the light of life from thine eye.</p>
  </div>  </div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page148" id="page148"></a>[pg 148]</span>

<p class="ind1">Hjalmar made answer<a id="footnotetaga3" name="footnotetaga3"></a><a href="#footnotea3"><sup>3</sup></a>:</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>With sixteen wounds is my mailcoat rent,</p>
<p class="i2">And the world is fading fast.</p>
<p>Blindly I tread in the gathering gloom,</p>
<p class="i2">Pierced to the heart at the last</p>
<p>By Angantyr's sword with its pitiless point</p>
<p class="i2">And its edges in poison cast.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>*I have given no cause to Ingibjörg</p>
<p class="i2">To hold my prowess light;</p>
<p>It shall never be said by our maidens at home</p>
<p class="i2">That I gave one thought to flight.</p>
<p>They shall hear how the battle was fought and won.&mdash;</p>
<p class="i2">How I wielded my sword in the fight.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>Five manors were mine, all nobly appointed,</p>
<p class="i2">Where I might have tarried and made good cheer.</p>
<p>Yet my heart was stirred by a restless longing</p>
<p class="i2">That urged me onward to Samsø here,</p>
<p>Where, pierced by the sword, with my life blood out pouring,</p>
<p class="i2">I shall linger and die on this island so drear.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>In my mind I can see the henchmen</p>
<p class="i2">Drinking mead in my father's hall.&mdash;</p>
<p>A circle of gold is round every throat,</p>
<p class="i2">And joy is among them all.</p>
<p>My merry companions are drinking their ale,</p>
<p class="i2">Till thought and care are no more,</p>
<p>While I, torn with wounds from a murderous sword,</p>
<p class="i2">Perish here on this island shore.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>*The lofty halls of Sigtun,</p>
<p class="i2">I see them from far away;</p>

<p class="i2">As we hastened forth on our way.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page149" id="page149"></a>[pg 149]</span>
<p>I shall never again see those maidens,</p>
<p class="i2">Or talk with the warriors bold,</p>
<p>Or drink fair ale in the King's high hall,</p>
<p class="i2">As I did in the days of old.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>In my heart a voice still lingers,</p>
<p class="i2">The voice of a maiden fair,</p>
<p>Who rode with me forth to Agni's meads,</p>
<p class="i2">And bade farewell to me there.</p>
<p>And true, too true, were the words she spake</p>
<p class="i2">From the depths of her despair,</p>
<p>That never again should I touch her lips,</p>
<p class="i2">Or tangle her golden hair.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>In my ear a song is ringing,</p>
<p class="i2">An echo from out the East,&mdash;</p>
<p>I heard it from Soti's cliffs on the night</p>
<p class="i2">When I left my friends at the feast.</p>
<p>How could I know that never again</p>
<p class="i2">Should I hear the maidens' lay,</p>

  </div>  </div>

<p>Then Hjalmar died<a id="footnotetaga4" name="footnotetaga4"></a><a href="#footnotea4"><sup>4</sup></a>. Odd brought the tidings
to Sweden; and the King's daughter could not
bear to live after Hjalmar, so she took her own
life. Angantyr and his brothers were laid in a barrow
in Samsø with all their weapons.</p>

them, and then piled up stones and sand on the top. They were
strongly constructed, and it was a great achievement. Odd was busy
at this work for a fortnight. Then he placed the berserks in with
their weapons and closed the barrows. After this Odd took Hjalmar's
body and carried it to a ship and conveyed it to Sweden."

<h3 style="margin-top: 3em;">BALLADS</h3>

<h4>GENERAL INTRODUCTION</h4>

<p>I. The ballads of the Faroe Islands aroused the
interest of Ole Worm as early as 1639; but the five
ballads which he took down are no longer extant,
and we know of them only from a reference by
Peder Syv<a id="footnotetagv1" name="footnotetagv1"></a><a href="#footnotev1"><sup>1</sup></a> towards the close of the seventeenth
century. In 1673 Lucas Debes<a id="footnotetagv2" name="footnotetagv2"></a><a href="#footnotev2"><sup>2</sup></a> wrote a description
of the islands which contained an account of their
dances and songs; but unfortunately he did not
transcribe any of the ballads. Indeed the balladry
and songs attracted little general attention till the
close of the eighteenth century, when Jens Kristjan
Svabo devoted himself to a careful study of the
language and a collection of the ballads of his native
Islands.</p>

<p>In 1781-2, during a visit to the Faroes, Svabo
turned his attention especially to Faroese folk-songs
and made a ms. collection of fifty-two ballads, which
were purchased by the Crown Prince and presented
to the Royal Library at Copenhagen. It is interesting
to note that Svabo, like his contemporary Bishop
Percy<a id="footnotetagv3" name="footnotetagv3"></a><a href="#footnotev3"><sup>3</sup></a>, thought it necessary to apologise in his preface
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page154" id="page154"></a>[pg 154]</span>
for making the collection, and humbly claims for it
an interest merely antiquarian. It is clear, however
from his tone throughout the Preface, that Svabo
had a far more scholarly appreciation of the value of
his material than had Percy. Indeed it would be
difficult to overestimate the debt which all succeeding
students of Faroese ballads owe to him. Disappointed
in his hopes of public recognition of his
work done for the Civil Service, he retired to the
Islands, where, in solitude and poverty, he devoted
himself, till his death in 1829, to the collection and
transcription of ballad material. His personal help
and example inspired other Faroe-islanders to make
collections for themselves, some of which, notably
Klemmentsen's <i>Sandoyjarbók</i>, are among our best
authorities for the ballads today. His own ballad
collection, still in ms. in the Royal Library at Copenhagen,
has never been published; but Schrøter,
Lyngbye and Hammershaimb all owed their incentive
and inspiration to his work. To study the history of
Faroese ballad collections without realising the force of
Svabo's personality is to leave Hamlet out of the play.</p>

<p>In 1817 the Danish botanist, Hans Kristjan
Lyngbye visited the Faroes, where he became acquainted
with "the learned Svabo" as he calls him,
and also with Johan Henrik Schrøter, a clergyman
on Suderø, himself a keenly interested ballad collector,
and, incidentally, the first to make a collection
of Faroese folk-tales in prose. Partly from these
men, and partly from oral recitations and material
supplied by Provost Hentze, Lyngbye was able to
gather together a considerable body of Faroese
ballads which, with the support and encouragement
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page155" id="page155"></a>[pg 155]</span>
of Bishop P. E. Müller, he published at Copenhagen
in 1822, under the title of <i>Færöiske Kvæder
om Sigurd Fofnersbane og hans Æt</i>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately Lyngbye knew no Icelandic and
very little Faroese, and his work necessarily suffers
in consequence. Still more unfortunate was his
unscientific handling of material and lack of literary
conscience, which permitted his cutting out, adding
and transposing stanzas&mdash;and again we are reminded
of the <i>Reliques</i>&mdash;till the original form of
a ballad is sometimes entirely lost. Fortunately,
however, most of the material that he had at his
command is still preserved. It is to be noted that
the qualities which go to make an ideal <i>collector</i> of
ballads do not always imply an ideal editor of the
material collected. The great collector of Jutland
ballads and folk-lore, Evald Tang Kristensen, has
started a new and sounder tradition by a reverent
in-gathering of all that formed part of the common
stock of peasant lore in his day<a id="footnotetagv4" name="footnotetagv4"></a><a href="#footnotev4"><sup>4</sup></a>. The sifting of
material is wisely left to the trained scholar, and, one
hopes, to a later and less intrepid generation<a id="footnotetagv5" name="footnotetagv5"></a><a href="#footnotev5"><sup>5</sup></a>.</p>

<p>The tradition started by Svabo and Lyngbye was
carried on by V. U. Hammershaimb, himself a
native of the Islands and a great lover of Faroese
folk-lore. During the years 1847-8, and again in
1853, he visited the Faroes expressly to study the
dialects, and to collect the native ballads and folklore,
which he published under the title of <i>Færöiske</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page156" id="page156"></a>[pg 156]</span>
<i>Kvæder</i> in the <i>Nordiske Literatur-Samfund</i>, the <i>Antiquarisk
Tidsskrift</i>, etc.</p>

<p>Like Svabo, Hammershaimb eventually returned
and settled on the Faroes; but unfortunately, owing
to the pressure of his administrative duties, he was
never able to spare time for a final revision of his
collection, though urged repeatedly to the work by
his friend Svend Grundtvig. Ultimately, however,
when Grundtvig himself undertook to make an
exhaustive critical edition of the Faroese ballads in
all their variant forms, Hammershaimb placed all
his material in his hands.</p>

<p>Svend Grundtvig and his colleague J. Bloch, of
the Royal Library staff, completed in 1876 their
great fifteen vol. <span class="sc">ms</span>. collection of Faroese ballads
with all their known variants, <i>Føroyja Kvæði</i>&mdash;<i>Corpus
Carminum Faeroensium</i>&mdash;<i>Færøernes Gamle
Folkeviser</i>. This was afterwards increased by Bloch to
sixteen volumes by the addition of much new material,
some of which was collected by Jakobsen in his
journey to the Faroes in 1887<a id="footnotetagv6" name="footnotetagv6"></a><a href="#footnotev6"><sup>6</sup></a>. Before beginning
the work Grundtvig had every available version,
whether in public or private hands, at his disposal,
so that he had a magnificent apparatus criticus. Unfortunately
the work has never been published, so
that owing to the difficulties of communication with
Denmark (which have proved to be insuperable) it
has been impossible for me to consult it. The first
three volumes, however, which include all the
Faroese ballads translated below, are based on
Hammershaimb's collections of 1851-1855. Hammershaimb
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page157" id="page157"></a>[pg 157]</span>
was himself a genuine scholar with a
sensitive literary conscience and a thorough knowledge
of all the Faroese dialects, and his work is
spoken of in the highest terms by Grundtvig in his
article on the <i>Corpus Carminum Faroensium</i><a id="footnotetagv7" name="footnotetagv7"></a><a href="#footnotev7"><sup>7</sup></a>. Moreover
Hammershaimb had consulted all the other available
versions of these ballads before printing; so that
it is improbable that when a comparison of the texts
can be made much alteration will be required.</p>

<p>II. The Faroe Islands are probably the only
place to be found in Western Europe where ballads
are still sung to the accompaniment of the dance.
The dance and song, it must be confessed, are gradually
losing their original character, while the
ballads are often long and unwieldy, sometimes,
as in the Ballad of Ívint Herintsson, running to
five divisions (<i>Tættir</i>) and over three hundred and
fifty verses. The verses are frequently chanted in
a solemn recitative, while the ballad tunes tend to
be confined chiefly to the refrains. The method of
supplying the melody, however, is subject to almost
endless variation. Sometimes old native folk tunes
are attached to special ballads, e.g. in the case of
<i>Vi hugged mid kaarde</i>; sometimes native ballads are
sung to Danish folk melodies and refrains as, e.g.
<i>Grindevisen</i>, sung to the tune of the Danish
<i>Burmand holder i Fjældet ut</i>. Sometimes in the
Faroese repertoire, Norse ballads are found complete
with their own melodies, e.g. <i>Sømandsviserne</i>, or sung
to Danish folk-tunes, e.g. <i>Zinklars Vise</i>. Most curious
of all is the method not infrequently resorted to in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page158" id="page158"></a>[pg 158]</span>
modern times of singing native ballads, often of
modern origin, to the tunes of the Protestant
Psalmody&mdash;a custom which may have had its origin
in the common practice of singing both ballads and
psalms on all momentous occasions, such as on the
night of a wedding, or before starting on a big fishing
expedition. The Islanders have little idea of tone
or melody and do not sing well; and eye-witnesses
of some of the ballad dances at Thorshaven aver that
the tunes sound less like dance music than melancholy
dirges. In <i>Folkesangen paa Færøerne</i> (<i>Færøske
Kvadmelodier</i>), pp. 85-140, Thuren has published a
large number of original ballad tunes. The characteristic
motifs of folk tunes are traceable throughout,
as well as their elusive qualities. Thus we find,
side by side with airs based on the ordinary major
and minor scales, others which, like mediaeval
church music, are based on a 'modal' or 'gapped'
tonal system. Indeed traces of the pentatonic scale
are not infrequently met with, especially in the tunes
attached to the earlier ballads. The majority of
Faroese melodies, however, have only one gap and
have more in common with the system of notation
found in Gregorian music than with the pentatonic
scale of many Hebridean lays. A further characteristic
of folk music which appears in most Faroese airs
is the curious form of close which rarely occurs on the
tonic. Not infrequently the theme ends on the leading
note or supertonic which strikes the ear with a perpetual
surprise, the cadence leading one to anticipate
a repetition rather than a conclusion of the air. The
reason is that these tunes, like many folk songs from
Somerset, the Appalachians and the Hebrides, were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page159" id="page159"></a>[pg 159]</span>
'circular,' that is, formed for continuous repetition
to suit the lengthy nature of the songs and ballads.</p>

<p>The ballad however is not a mere historical relic
on the Faroes, but a living literary form. The
simplicity of the life, and the absence of class distinction<a id="footnotetagv8" name="footnotetagv8"></a><a href="#footnotev8"><sup>8</sup></a>,
still constitute an atmosphere in some
respects not unlike that of Mediaeval Denmark, and
the ballad is the favourite form of artistic expression.
A whale-hunt, a shipwreck, or the adventures of
fishermen in the far north are still made the subject
of a new ballad, composed by one or more of the
community; and if the result finds general favour
it is added to the ballad repertoire along with the
ballads of Sir Tristram or Childe Sigurth<a id="footnotetagv9" name="footnotetagv9"></a><a href="#footnotev9"><sup>9</sup></a>.</p>

<p>In his description of his travels on the Faroes
1847-8, V. U. Hammershaimb<a id="footnotetagv10" name="footnotetagv10"></a><a href="#footnotev10"><sup>10</sup></a> says that he took
down the greater number of his ballads at Sumbø
on Suderø, the most southerly village in the Islands.
He describes the ballad dance as follows:</p>

<blockquote><p>
It is the custom here that the same ballad should not be
sung more than once a year<a id="footnotetagv11" name="footnotetagv11"></a><a href="#footnotev11"><sup>11</sup></a> in the 'dancing-chamber,' so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page160" id="page160"></a>[pg 160]</span>
that the repertoire is obviously extensive, seeing that they
dance at wedding feasts, generally for three days and nights
without cessation. In the special dancing season from Yule
till Lent, the ballads are danced not only on Sundays but
also on the so-called 'Feast Days.' (They do not dance again
from the beginning of Lent till the day after Christmas.)
The dance at Sumbø has characteristics of its own which
differ from those of the rest of the Faroes. The people here
generally sing well and know how to put expression into the
actual dance. Elsewhere on the Islands this is now for the
most part reduced to a uniform stamp with the feet, marking
the melody of the ballad. Moreover they still continue here
in common use both the 'Walking Verse' (<i>stigingar stev</i>)
and the more rapid measure 'Tripping Verse' (<i>trókingar
stev</i>) of the Round Dance, in which, as a rule, the dancers
hold one another by the hand, forming a circle, dancing
backwards while the verse (<i>örindi</i>) is sung, and reversing the
movement with considerable energy during the singing of
the refrain (<i>viðgangur, niðurlág, stev</i>). This round dance is
characteristic of Sumbø<a id="footnotetagv12" name="footnotetagv12"></a><a href="#footnotev12"><sup>12</sup></a>.
</p></blockquote>

<p>For the most part the dance is now performed with
the same speed in both verse and refrain<a id="footnotetagv13" name="footnotetagv13"></a><a href="#footnotev13"><sup>13</sup></a>, and
though little changed since Hammershaimb wrote,
it tends more and more to become a solemn and
joyless function; and there is a curious unanimity
today among eyewitnesses as to the depressing effect it
has on them. Hjalmar Thuren, writing in later times
(1908), furnishes some additional information as to the
manner of the ballad dance<a id="footnotetagv14" name="footnotetagv14"></a><a href="#footnotev14"><sup>14</sup></a>. The ballads are danced
with special zest on the 29th of July, the day of the
anniversary of the death of Saint Olaf, when all the
islanders who can leave their homes flock to Thorshaven
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page161" id="page161"></a>[pg 161]</span>
and dance from sunset till sunrise. Sometimes
the ballads are danced in the open air, and it has been
the custom in certain districts from ancient times to
hold assemblies for dancing out in the fields on certain
fixed days. On the 12th Sunday after Trinity people
meet in definite places on the Northern Islands. On
the other hand the dance is often the spontaneous
outcome of the desire of the moment, "as much to
keep themselves warm as for the sake of entertainment."
Thus after a whale-hunt the men sometimes
dance in their wet, bloody clothes, singing the
popular ballad of the ca'ing whale with the refrain:</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>To us bold men great joy it is</p>
<p>To slay a whale!</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>The dance is always accompanied by song, but
instrumental music has never been in use on the
Faroes. The time and character of the dance are indicated
at the beginning of the ballad by the precentor.
This post of honour was originally much sought after
and some precentors were famous over the islands
for their special rendering of certain ballads, some
of which were family possessions in the old days.</p>

<p>When a ballad is concluded, one of those who are
taking part straightway begins on a new one, the
dance frequently continuing uninterrupted, even
when the song is ended. The precentor must have a
strong voice and great powers of endurance as the
ballads are often very long. He is generally of a
lively disposition with some dramatic power, so that
by imitating his gesticulations the dancers give
character and individuality to the ballad. Thus in
the refrain to the <i>Death-Song of Ragnar Loðbrók</i>:</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p><i>We struck with the sword</i></p>
  </div>  </div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page162" id="page162"></a>[pg 162]</span>

<p>the dancers stamp on the floor and clap hands together;
but they are solemn and silent during the
singing of a sorrowful ballad such as</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Queen Dagmar lies sick, etc.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>With the ballad dances of the Faroes it is interesting
to compare the ballad dances of the Ukraine and
also the choral dances of a community so far removed
as the Torres Straits. Of these latter Dr Haddon
writes<a id="footnotetagv15" name="footnotetagv15"></a><a href="#footnotev15"><sup>15</sup></a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>
The dancing-ground was an oblong space.... The drummer
with the singers generally struck up a song, but sometimes
the dancers sang a refrain or called for a song by name. Each
song seemed to be associated with its own particular dance
and to be <i>accompanied by some story or incident</i> which was
illustrated by the movements of the dancers.
</p></blockquote>

<p>A much closer parallel, however, is furnished by
the <ins title="transcriber's note: Cyrillic: Khorovod">&#x04b2;&#x043e;&#x0440;&#x043e;&#x0432;&#x043e;&#x0434;&#x044a;</ins> or choral dance of Little Russia.
The <ins title="transcriber's note: Cyrillic: Khorovod">&#x04b2;&#x043e;&#x0440;&#x043e;&#x0432;&#x043e;&#x0434;&#x044a;</ins>, according to the account of an
eye witness<a id="footnotetagv16" name="footnotetagv16"></a><a href="#footnotev16"><sup>16</sup></a>, is not only a song sung to the accompaniment
of a dance; but the song is narrative in form
and answers in all respects to the ballad of North
Western Europe. The dancers join hands and dance
in a circle from west to east, in a contrary direction
to the sun's movements&mdash;<i>withershins</i> as the Scots
peasants have it. Then, because it is considered
unlucky to do anything <i>withershins</i>, in the refrain
the motion is reversed and the dancers pass from
east to west, to counteract the baleful effects of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page163" id="page163"></a>[pg 163]</span>
first direction. Here too, however, it is interesting
to note, the dance is sometimes stationary.</p>

<p>III. Into the rise of the ballads on the Faroes and
their exact relation of form and content to the Icelandic
<i>Fornkvæði</i><a id="footnotetagv17" name="footnotetagv17"></a><a href="#footnotev17"><sup>17</sup></a>,
and to the <i>Viser</i> of Norway<a id="footnotetagv18" name="footnotetagv18"></a><a href="#footnotev18"><sup>18</sup></a>,
Sweden<a id="footnotetagv19" name="footnotetagv19"></a><a href="#footnotev19"><sup>19</sup></a>,
and above all of Denmark<a id="footnotetagv20" name="footnotetagv20"></a><a href="#footnotev20"><sup>20</sup></a>, it is impossible
to enter here. Perhaps the relationship between the
ballads of the various countries of the North will
never be fully understood. The ramifications are too
many and too complex, while too many links in the
chain have already been lost in the "scrubby paper
books" such as that with which Bishop Percy found
the housemaid lighting the parlour fire. And those
who would too hastily dogmatise on the 'conveyance',
translation, and borrowing of the various
versions receive a wholesome warning from Dr Axel
Olrik's analysis<a id="footnotetagv21" name="footnotetagv21"></a><a href="#footnotev21"><sup>21</sup></a> of the ancestry and parallel versions
of the Scots, Icelandic, Swedish, Norwegian and
Danish forms of the ballads of Earl Brand (Dan.
<i>Riboldsvisen</i>). Moreover it is no easier to generalise
about the sources of the Faroese ballad material than
about the Danish. The motif of the Faroese <i>Tristrams
Táttur</i>, also found in the Icelandic ballad of <i>Tristram</i>
comes ultimately (through the Tristram's Saga one
would suppose) from a French romance; that of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page164" id="page164"></a>[pg 164]</span>
Nornagest, changed though it is in form, is surely
founded on the Icelandic Saga; <i>Olufu Kvæði</i> comes
no doubt from a Spanish story; and the motif of the
Scots ballad of <i>Binnorie</i> is "found also among the
people of Ireland, Norway, Sweden, Denmark and
the Faroes<a id="footnotetagv22" name="footnotetagv22"></a><a href="#footnotev22"><sup>22</sup></a>."</p>

<p>It would be pleasant to develop a theory that the
purveyors of ballad material were the sailors and
merchants who plied up and down the great trade
routes in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, or
even earlier. It has been suggested by Professor Ker<a id="footnotetagv23" name="footnotetagv23"></a><a href="#footnotev23"><sup>23</sup></a>
and others that Shetland <i>may</i> have been "the chief
meeting-place or trading station between the ballads
of Scotland and Norway." The Shetland ballad
of <i>Sir Orfeo</i> actually has a refrain in Norn, the
Norse dialect spoken in Shetland and the small
neighbouring islands till the eighteenth century;
while the ballad of <i>Hildina</i> taken down by Low<a id="footnotetagv24" name="footnotetagv24"></a><a href="#footnotev24"><sup>24</sup></a> on
the Island of Foula off Shetland (cf. p. 217 below)
is entirely composed in Norn. Indeed we know from
Low's account<a id="footnotetagv25" name="footnotetagv25"></a><a href="#footnotev25"><sup>25</sup></a> that many ballads and songs must
have perished with the language:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Nothing remains but a few names of things and two or
three remnants of songs which one old man can repeat;
</p></blockquote>

<p>and further on he continues:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Most of the fragments they have are <i>old historical ballads
and romances</i>.... William Henry, a farmer in Guttorm in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page165" id="page165"></a>[pg 165]</span>
Foula has the most knowledge of any I found; he spoke of
three kinds of poetry used in Norn, and repeated or sung by
the old men; the Ballad (or Romance, I suppose); <i>the Vysie
or vyse, now commonly sung to dancers</i><a id="footnotetagv26" name="footnotetagv26"></a><a href="#footnotev26"><sup>26</sup></a>; and the simple song....
Most of all their tales are relative to the history of Norway;
they seem to know little of the rest of Europe but by names;
Norwegian transactions they have at their fingers' ends.
</p></blockquote>

<p>One would like to have known more about Norn
and its 'Vysies,' which might have formed an interesting
and instructive link between some of the
Northern ballads. On the other hand, the Scandinavian
colonies in Ireland, and settlers in English
ports such as Bristol, may have done not a little,
through their trade with France and the Mediterranean
countries, to spread the new rhyming four
line verse and the romantic stories of southern and
eastern Europe<a id="footnotetagv27" name="footnotetagv27"></a><a href="#footnotev27"><sup>27</sup></a>.</p>

<p>While this obscurity remains as to the connection
between the Faroese ballads and those of neighbouring
countries, notably Denmark, the questions
of the age and origin of many of the Faroese ballads
in their present form are also frought with difficulty.
Of the Danish ballads, which sometimes offer
parallels so close as to suggest translation from one
language to the other, the first MS. collection that
can be dated with certainty was written down in
1550. But there is much evidence, both internal and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page166" id="page166"></a>[pg 166]</span>
external, for assigning a much earlier date to the
historical ballads at least. It has been suggested by
Olrik<a id="footnotetagv28" name="footnotetagv28"></a><a href="#footnotev28"><sup>28</sup></a>, who supports his view by arguments which
it would be extremely difficult to contest, that many
of the historical ballads are practically contemporaneous
with the events which they describe, and
some of these took place in the thirteenth century,
while others, e.g. <i>Riboldsvisen</i>, are possibly of the
twelfth century.</p>

<p>Unfortunately we have fewer data, whether philological
or historical, for assigning dates to the
Faroese ballads than we have for the Danish. There
can be little doubt, however, that the ballads translated
below had their origin in the <i>Fornaldar Sögur</i>
composed in Iceland during the thirteenth century
or in some fourteenth century <i>Rímur</i> derived from
the sagas. That many of the Faroese ballads were
literary in origin<a id="footnotetagv29" name="footnotetagv29"></a><a href="#footnotev29"><sup>29</sup></a>, and were based on either Sagas or
Rímur, is conclusively established by the opening
lines of many of the ballads themselves, notably that
of the <i>Olufu Ríma</i>:</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Ein er ríman ur Íslandi komin,</p>
<p>Skrívað í bók so breiða.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<blockquote><p>
("This story is come from Iceland, written in a book so
broad.")
</p></blockquote>

<p class="ind1">And <i>Tröllini í Hornalandum</i>:</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Verse 1. &nbsp;&nbsp;Frøðíð er komið frá Íslandí</p>
<p class="i8"> Skrívað í bók so víða <i>etc.</i></p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page167" id="page167"></a>[pg 167]</span>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>Verse 2. &nbsp;&nbsp;Frøðið er komið frá Íslandi</p>
<p class="i8">Skrívað í bók so breiða <i>etc.</i></p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>Verse 3. &nbsp;&nbsp;Frøðið er komið frá Íslandi</p>
<p class="i8">Higar ið skald tað tók,</p>
<p class="i8">Havið tær hoyrt um kongin tann,</p>
<p class="i8">Íð skrívaður stendur í bók?</p>
  </div>  </div>

<blockquote><p>
("This poem has come from Iceland, brought hither by
a <i>skald</i>. Have you heard of the king about whom this book
is written?")
</p></blockquote>

<p>The passages quoted above would seem to point to
Rímur rather than Sagas as the sources of the ballads.
Or had more than one "Book so broad" come
from Iceland? One wonders. Heusler notices<a id="footnotetagv30" name="footnotetagv30"></a><a href="#footnotev30"><sup>30</sup></a> the
tendency to divide up the longer ballads into sections
or <i>Tættir</i>, each whole in itself and yet forming a part
of the ballad, and suggests the Icelandic <i>Rímur</i> as
the models for this particular form. It is even possible
that the word <i>Ríma</i> is used advisedly in the first
strophe of <i>Olufu Kvæði</i>, instead of the somewhat
commoner <i>Kvæði</i>, with some reminiscence of its
origin. One of the <i>Sjurðar Kvæði</i> (<i>Dvörgamoy</i> III)
begins:</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Eina veit eg rímuna,</p>
<p>Íð inni hevir ligið leingi.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>(I know a rhyme (or <i>Ríma</i>?) etc.)</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>and <i>Rísin í Holmgarð</i> also begins:</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Eg veit eina rímuna,</p>
<p>Íð gjörd er um Virgar sterka.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Many other instances might be quoted.</p>

<p>But it would be perilous to press too far what may,
after all, be a mere verbal coincidence. And whatever
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page168" id="page168"></a>[pg 168]</span>
gave rise to our poems as they now stand, it cannot
be too strongly emphasised that they, like
the rest of the <i>Føroyja Kvæði</i>, are first and last
<i>Ballads</i>&mdash;rightly ballads. They have a form of their
own, like other ballads, and are not a degenerate form
of <i>Rímur</i> or a mere versification of some old Icelandic
legends. Indeed what Professor Ker says of the
Danish ballads<a id="footnotetagv31" name="footnotetagv31"></a><a href="#footnotev31"><sup>31</sup></a> may with equal truth be applied to
the ballads of the Faroes:</p>

<blockquote><p>
The ballads are not rude, rustic travesties of older more
dignified stories; though some, perhaps many, of the older
stories may survive among the ballads. They are for Denmark
in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries what the older
heroic lays of the Poetic Edda had been before them in the
Northern lands. They take the place of earlier heroic poetry.
</p></blockquote>

<p>Whatever the nature of their connection with the
ballads of the surrounding lands, the Faroese ballads
are no isolated growth. They exhibit all the main
characteristics of the ballad type, especially of the
Danish, Norwegian and Icelandic ballads. Crude and
inartistic they often are compared with the best of the
Danish and even the Scottish ballads. The <i>Ballad of
Hjalmar and Angantyr</i> has little to recommend it
beyond its simplicity and naïveté, the 'quaintness' of
primitive literature; the <i>Ballad of Arngrim's Sons</i> exhibits
a curious lack of skill in the manipulation of
the theme, and perhaps we are justified in assuming
that two earlier ballads or perhaps <i>tættir</i> have been
imperfectly welded. The <i>Ballad of Nornagest</i> is bald
to a fault and lacks inspiration; and all alike show an
imperfect artistry in diction.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page169" id="page169"></a>[pg 169]</span>

<p>Yet despite all these blemishes they are ballads as
surely as <i>Sir Patrick Spens</i> or <i>Ungen Sveidal</i> are
ballads. Nor is Professor Ker quite just to the ballads
of the Faroes in saying<a id="footnotetagv32" name="footnotetagv32"></a><a href="#footnotev32"><sup>32</sup></a> that because of their length,
and "because they were made out of books, nothing
but the lyrical form and the dancing custom kept
them from turning into ordinary romances." Surely
no material could be less promising than King
Heithrek's Riddles; yet in virtue of what has been
forgotten and what has been selected&mdash;the telescoping
of the riddles and the elaboration of the setting&mdash;the
ballad spirit has entered in and shaped from the
unwieldy mass an artistic whole.</p>

<p>Indeed whatever their faults one realises in all
these ballads the truth of Sidgwick's epigram<a id="footnotetagv33" name="footnotetagv33"></a><a href="#footnotev33"><sup>33</sup></a>:
"You never know what a ballad will say next, though
you <i>do</i> know how it is going to say it!" For it is even
less similarity of theme than similarity of form that
links the ballads of the Faroes with those of Denmark
and the North. The invariable accompaniment of
the refrain; the fluctuation between assonance and
rhyme, the disregard of alliteration, and the general
verse form; the love of repetition and ballad formulae,&mdash;especially
of repetition of whole phrases or verses
with the alteration of merely the words that rhyme,
or of repetition with inversion of word order; the
balladist's love of colour, of the material and the
concrete, of glitter and shine; the large element of
dialogue; the abrupt dramatic openings; the condensation
and concentration of narrative and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page170" id="page170"></a>[pg 170]</span>
strict exclusion of the irrelevant or superfluous;
the infallible feeling for a 'situation'; the atmosphere
of the tragic or the critical; the "echo,
without comment, of the clash of man and fate<a id="footnotetagv34" name="footnotetagv34"></a><a href="#footnotev34"><sup>34</sup></a>."
All these are the elements that make the ballad a
form of literature distinct from other lyric or epic
forms; all these are the elements that go to make the
Faroese ballads what they are&mdash;part of what Ker calls
the "Platonic Idea, a Ballad in itself, unchangeable
and one, of which the phenomenal multitude of
ballads are 'partakers<a id="footnotetagv35" name="footnotetagv35"></a><a href="#footnotev35"><sup>35</sup></a>.'"</p>

<h3 style="margin-top: 3em;">INTRODUCTION TO GRÍPLUR I</h3>

<p>In the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries in Iceland,
many of the Sagas or portions of them were turned
into rhyming verse known as <i>Rímur</i>. Sagas of almost
every class were subjected to this treatment&mdash;<i>Íslendinga
Sögur</i>, <i>Fornaldar Sögur</i>, <i>Fornmanna Sögur</i>
and others. It is supposed that in the first place these
rhymed versions (<i>Rímur</i>) were made for the purpose
of recitation at social gatherings. There is ground for
believing that the <i>Rímur</i> were sometimes recited, as
an accompaniment of dances in Iceland<a id="footnotetagvi1" name="footnotetagvi1"></a><a href="#footnotevi1"><sup>1</sup></a>; but this is
not believed to have been the purpose for which they
were originally composed<a id="footnotetagvi2" name="footnotetagvi2"></a><a href="#footnotevi2"><sup>2</sup></a>.</p>

<p>According to both Jónsson<a id="footnotetagvi3" name="footnotetagvi3"></a><a href="#footnotevi3"><sup>3</sup></a>
and Mogk<a id="footnotetagvi4" name="footnotetagvi4"></a><a href="#footnotevi4"><sup>4</sup></a>, the
<i>Rímur</i> and other forms of rhyming verse in early
Norse poetry originated in the Mediaeval Latin
Church Hymns introduced into Iceland in the
thirteenth century. The similarity between the
rhyming metres of the Latin and many (though not
all) of the forms of verse used in the <i>Rímur</i> is very
striking. Whether the influence of Latin hymns in
Iceland was directly responsible for the change,
however, as Jónsson and Mogk believe, or whether
the Latin hymns only influenced Norse verse indirectly
through the medium of French poetry, is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page172" id="page172"></a>[pg 172]</span>
problematical. Perhaps these compositions owe
their origin to the fashion of turning all kinds of
material, likely and unlikely, into rhyming verse&mdash;a
fashion which originated in France, and from the
latter part of the twelfth century onwards gradually
made its way over most of the West and North of
Europe. The rhyming chronicles of the fourteenth
century in England may be mentioned as one instance
of this fashion, and the rhyming paraphrases
of the splendid prose of Iceland are an outcome of
the same movement.</p>

<p>The <i>Gríplur</i>, some twenty stanzas of which are
given below, represent this stage in the development
of Icelandic literature. It may be observed that, like
other <i>Rímur</i>, they are the work of educated people&mdash;a
fact which makes the wretched quality of much of
the verse all the more striking, especially when they
are contrasted with the ballads, which are, at least in
most cases, the work of the unlettered. Unattractive
however as they appear to the modern mind, it has
been thought advisable to include a short extract
from them here because it seems possible that in
some cases the Faroese ballads may have derived
their material from Iceland through the intermediate
stage of the <i>Rímur</i> rather than from the Saga direct.</p>

<p>Reference is made to the exploits of Hromund in
other <i>Rímur</i> besides the <i>Gríplur</i>, notably in the
<i>Málsháttakvæði</i>, the <i>Skíða-Ríma</i><a id="footnotetagvi5" name="footnotetagvi5"></a><a href="#footnotevi5"><sup>5</sup></a> (which is interesting
as being based, in all probability, on an earlier poem
than the <i>Gríplur</i>) and in the <i>Klerka-Ríma</i><a id="footnotetagvi6" name="footnotetagvi6"></a><a href="#footnotevi6"><sup>6</sup></a>. And he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page173" id="page173"></a>[pg 173]</span>
and Thrain the Berserk still live in the popular songs
of the North. He is the <i>Ungen Ranild</i><a id="footnotetagvi7" name="footnotetagvi7"></a><a href="#footnotevi7"><sup>7</sup></a> of the Danish
ballad; and in the Norwegian ballad <i>Ramund den
Unge</i><a id="footnotetagvi8" name="footnotetagvi8"></a><a href="#footnotevi8"><sup>8</sup></a>, Ramund (Hromund) and Hölgi (Helgi)
appear as rivals for the hand of Svanhvit (who,
however, is not mentioned by name). Like some
of the Faroese ballads on the <i>Hervarar Saga</i>, these
later versions are far removed from the story as we
know it from early Icelandic sources<a id="footnotetagvi9" name="footnotetagvi9"></a><a href="#footnotevi9"><sup>9</sup></a>. They are of
interest only to those who care for folk song and
ballad for their freshness and their naïve simplicity<a id="footnotetagvi10" name="footnotetagvi10"></a><a href="#footnotevi10"><sup>10</sup></a>.</p>

<h3 style="margin-top: 3em;">INTRODUCTION TO THE FAROESE BALLAD OF NORNAGEST</h3>

<p>The <i>Ballad of Nornagest</i> was published for the
first time by Lyngbye in 1822 in <i>Færöiske Kvæder
om Sigurd Fofnersbane</i> etc. In his visit to the Faroes
in 1847-8, Hammershaimb took down the ballad
from oral recitation at Sumbø. He afterwards
collated his version carefully with those of Svabo,
Schrøter and Lyngbye, and published the result in
<i>Færöiske Kvæder</i>, Vol. <span class="sc">i</span>, Copenhagen, 1851. This is
the version of the ballad translated below.</p>

<p>Lyngbye points out that Nornagest has become a
well-known character in modern Faroese legend. We
certainly note his popularity in the ballads, which
is no doubt due to his association with Sigurth in
the original story. In some ballads he appears as a
companion in arms of the latter and even as a great
warrior himself. He it is who rides with Sigurth and
Virgar to meet the giant in Holmgarth (cf. <i>Rísin í
Holmgarðum</i>, v. 33), and in <i>Ragnarlikkja</i> (cf. v. 39 ff.)
"the fierce Nornagest" sails with Sigurth, Brand,
and Virgar to slay the King of Girtland; and so too
in other stories.</p>

<p>It will be observed that the framework of the story
differs considerably from that of the Saga, notably
in the opening and closing scenes. The beginning of
another story, dealing likewise with an old man,
has been substituted for the original opening. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page177" id="page177"></a>[pg 177]</span>
mention of the boat in verse 40 is perhaps reminiscent
of some folk-tale; and the story of the leaden casket
containing the soul of Nornagest which was sunk in
the lake is an interesting instance of the external soul.
I have no doubt that it is a reference to some folk-tale,
but have not yet been able to identify it. Among
many primitive peoples, who can hardly grasp abstract
ideas, the life or soul of a man is regarded as
a concrete thing which can be laid aside, and which,
so long as it remains unharmed, will secure for him
immortality. There is, for example, a Hindoo story
of a princess whose soul was believed to be in her
necklace.&mdash;One day an astrologer said to her parents:
"This is no common child; the necklace of gold
about her neck contains your daughter's soul; let
it therefore be guarded with the utmost care; for if it
were taken off and worn by another person, she
would die<a id="footnotetagvii1" name="footnotetagvii1"></a><a href="#footnotevii1"><sup>1</sup></a>."</p>

<p>Many similar folk-tales are known from Icelandic
and Danish sources as well as from many parts of
Europe and Asia.</p>

<p>The air to which the following ballad is sung will
be found on pp. 117, 118 of Thuren's <i>Folkesangen
paa Færøerne</i>.</p>

<h3 style="margin-top: 3em;">INTRODUCTION TO THE BALLAD OF HJALMAR AND ANGANTYR</h3>

<p>The following ballad was taken down by Hammershaimb
from oral recitation in Westmanhavn
in 1846, and published at Copenhagen in 1855 in
<i>Færöiske Kvæder</i>, Vol. <span class="sc">ii</span>. He took down a second
version of the same ballad, but consisting of only
nineteen stanzas, at Sumbø in 1847, which he published
in the <i>Antiquarisk Tidsskrift</i>, 1849-50. This
second version differs slightly from the one given in
our text. In it Arngrim is said to have twelve sons
of whom Angantyr was the youngest. Hjalmar is
not expressly stated to have been a brother of
Angantyr, as he is in our version and in the Danish
ballad <i>Angelfyr and Helmer the Warrior</i> (cf. p. 188 ff.).
Moreover Angantyr is the first to learn of the
franklin's daughter, and he forthwith builds a ship
and sails away alone; and it is only later that Hjalmar
also hears of her and sets sail, thus reaching the spot
when Angantyr has already landed. More colour
is given to the maiden's choice in the second version
by the additional detail that</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Hjalmar leapt so lightly to land,</p>
<p>He made no footprint on the sand.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>This, however, it is to be noted, is the regular
formula by which the landing of the hero is described
in the Faroese ballads. Cf. <i>Lokka Táttur</i>, v. 78.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page183" id="page183"></a>[pg 183]</span>

<p>It is the opinion of Hammershaimb that this
ballad was the original from which the longer ballad
of <i>Arngrim's Sons</i> sprang. This would seem to be
supported by Heusler's contention that <i>The Long
Ballad</i> of the <i>Marsk Stig</i> Cycle was composed by
welding together several shorter ballads<a id="footnotetagviii1" name="footnotetagviii1"></a><a href="#footnoteviii1"><sup>1</sup></a>; and certainly
the <i>Ballad of Arngrim's Sons</i> suggests that at
least two distinct ballads have been run into one,
especially when we compare the two varying versions
of Svabo and Hammershaimb. Against this, however,
we have to place the fact that something of the
same invertebrate impression is given by the <i>Saga
of Hervör and Heithrek</i>, on which these ballads are
ultimately based. Even if we assume a composite
origin for the <i>Ballad of Arngrim's Sons</i>, there is
no evidence that any portion of it was based on
the short <i>Ballad of Hjalmar and Angantyr</i>, while
the difference of metre diminishes the probability
of a connection.</p>

<p>The air and refrain to this ballad are given on
p. 124 of Thuren's <i>Folkesangen paa Færøerne</i>.</p>

<h3 style="margin-top: 3em;">INTRODUCTION TO THE DANISH BALLAD OF<br />
ANGELFYR AND HELMER THE WARRIOR</h3>

<p>Four different versions of the Danish ballad of
<i>Angelfyr and Helmer the Warrior</i> are given by
Grundtvig in <i>Danmarks Gamle Folkeviser</i>, Vol. <span class="sc">i</span>,
number 19 (Copenhagen, 1853). Two of these, closely
allied, are found in a <span class="sc">ms</span>. written in the sixteenth
century<a id="footnotetagix1" name="footnotetagix1"></a><a href="#footnoteix1"><sup>1</sup></a>. The version which Grundtvig has called <i>A</i>
is the one adopted for translation below.</p>

<p>An interesting study in ballad composition is
afforded by a comparison of this Danish ballad with
the Faroese ballads of the <i>Sons of Arngrim</i>. According
to Axel Olrik<a id="footnotetagix2" name="footnotetagix2"></a><a href="#footnoteix2"><sup>2</sup></a> the Danish ballad is founded on the
<i>Saga of Hervör and Heithrek</i>. That the ultimate source
of all the ballads of the <i>Sons of Arngrim</i> was the Saga
there can be no doubt. But whether the Danish
ballad is derived directly from the Saga or through
some intermediate stage, Icelandic, Faroese or Danish,
is problematical. A definite relationship between the
Danish and the Faroese ballads would seem to be
shown by several common features of the story
which do not occur in the Saga itself, as well as by
some striking verbal resemblances which have no
foundation in the prose narrative.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page187" id="page187"></a>[pg 187]</span>

<p>Thus on the one hand both in the Danish and in
the Faroese ballads translated above, Hjalmar and
Angantyr are described as brothers<a id="footnotetagix3" name="footnotetagix3"></a><a href="#footnoteix3"><sup>3</sup></a>, whereas in the
Saga they are not related. On the other hand the
Danish and the two Faroese ballads are almost
identical in their description of Angantyr and all his
kin as "vile trolls," though Version <i>A</i> given by
Grundtvig describes him in accordance with the Saga
as a "half-troll" (i.e. on his mother's side).</p>

<p>Other close verbal parallels, surely indicative of
cross-relationship or of a common source, are afforded
by a comparison of certain passages of the Danish
ballad and the Faroese <i>Ballad of Arngrim's Sons</i>. Thus
<i>v. 5</i> of the Danish is practically identical with <i>v. 74</i> of
the Faroese, and we may compare <i>v. 9</i> of the shorter
<i>Ballad of Hjalmar and Angantyr</i>. May we also compare
<i>v. 6</i> of the Danish with <i>v. 79</i> of the longer
Faroese ballad; <i>v. 8</i> with <i>v. 81</i>; <i>v. 10</i> with <i>v. 84</i>;
<i>v. 14</i> with <i>v. 79</i>? Conventional as many of these
phrases are, the identity can hardly be accidental
in all cases.</p>

<p>The precise nature of the relationship between the
two versions is not so clear. We may note, however,
some of the features contained in the Danish version
of the story which are not found in the Saga. In the
first place neither Arngrim nor Samsø are mentioned,
the names Offue and Uthiss-kier being substituted
for them<a id="footnotetagix4" name="footnotetagix4"></a><a href="#footnoteix4"><sup>4</sup></a>; secondly, except in the refrain there is no
mention of the sea or a voyage in the Danish ballad.
Helmer bids them "saddle his steed," and both he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page188" id="page188"></a>[pg 188]</span>
and Angelfyr <i>ride</i> to Upsala. Finally after <i>v. 11</i> of
our text, the Danish ballad differs entirely from the
Faroese version of the story and also from that of the
<i>Saga of Hervör and Heithrek</i>. Offue's revenge is
peculiar to the Danish, and here too no mention is
made of Ingibjörg's death.</p>

<p>From all these changes, and especially from the
transference of names and places, it is obvious that
the Danish version of the story is considerably more
remote from the Saga than either of the two Faroese
versions. At the same time, the absence of any
reference to Samsø or any other Danish locality
renders it highly improbable that its divergences are
due to any (Danish) local tradition independent of
the Saga.</p>

<p>On the whole it would seem that at an early date
(fifteenth or early sixteenth century?) a ballad had
been made from this portion of the Saga, either
directly or through the intermediate stage of a lost
rhymed version; and that it was composed in the
Faroes themselves or in Iceland or some other region&mdash;the
Orkneys and Shetlands are a possible suggestion&mdash;and
acquired by the Danes not very long afterwards.</p>

<h3 style="margin-top: 3em;">INTRODUCTION TO THE FAROESE BALLAD OF ARNGRIM'S SONS</h3>

<p>The <i>Ballad of Arngrim's Sons</i> was first taken down
by Svabo towards the close of the eighteenth century.
He never published it, but his <span class="sc">ms</span>. (<span class="sc">iii</span>. 9) is preserved
in the Royal Library at Copenhagen. In
1848 V. U. Hammershaimb took the ballad down
again from oral recitation on Sandø and published
it in the <i>Antiquarisk Tídsskrift</i>, 1849-1851 (Copenhagen,
1852). He had, however, consulted Svabo's
version, for he says in the prefatory note to the
ballad:</p>

<blockquote><p>
It is entirely confused in Svabo's version in the Royal
Library. I have therefore kept to the version which I got on
Sandø, which in the main points agrees with the Saga. Only
in the conclusion and two other passages have I followed
Svabo's version.
</p></blockquote>

<p>By 1855, however, it would seem that his view
had changed. In his prefatory note to the <i>Ballad
of Arngrim's Sons</i>, published in <i>Nordiske Oldskrifter</i>,
vols. 18-19, Part II (Copenhagen, 1855), he writes:</p>

<blockquote><p>
The version given by Svabo is at variance with the Saga
and has many internal discrepancies arising mainly from the
fact that Hjalmar and Angantyr are here taken to be brothers,
as in the Danish ballad. In the <i>Antiquarisk Tídsskrift</i> for
1849-1851 I published another version which I took down
in Sandø in 1848, and in which I made some use of Svabo's
version. My version corresponds exactly with the <i>Harvarar
Saga</i>, but it is open to suspicion from the fact that it
here forms the second part (<i>tháttr</i>) of <i>Hjalmar's Kvæði</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page194" id="page194"></a>[pg 194]</span>
of which the first part (<i>The Tháttr of Örvar-Oddr</i>) is clearly
of later origin; as is shown not only by the language, but also
by the fact that the whole falls in with Suhm's story,&mdash;"The
three friends, Hjalmar, Asbjörn and Örvarodd," etc.
Many verses of <i>Arngrim's Sons</i> presuppose a first <i>táttur</i>
to the ballad, for example that in which the sick Asbjörn
complains that he cannot follow his companion to the fight
on Samsø<a id="footnotetagxi1" name="footnotetagxi1"></a><a href="#footnotexi1"><sup>1</sup></a>. That the language in the second part is purer and
older than in the first part is easily explained from the fact
that the people of Sandø have utilised the older Faroese version
which was taken down by Svabo. They only needed to
transpose the verses and to make a very few changes to get
the whole readjusted according to the Saga or Suhm's
story. The verses which the Sandø version has in common
with Svabo's could therefore be used for purposes of comparison.
There are thus weighty reasons for giving preference
to Svabo's version, in spite of all its imperfections.
</p></blockquote>

<p>Of the first part of <i>Hjalmar's Kvæði</i> I have unfortunately
been unable to obtain a copy, though it
is no doubt accessible at Copenhagen, as it is mentioned
as number 60 ('<i>Hjalmar's Kvæði</i>, 2 tættir:
<i>a</i>, Örvaroddur, <i>b</i>, Arngrim's Sinir') in a list of
Faroese ballads taken down in the Faroes by Hammershaimb
for the archaeological archives of the
Royal Old Norse Text Society<a id="footnotetagxi2" name="footnotetagxi2"></a><a href="#footnotexi2"><sup>2</sup></a>. Hammershaimb
says<a id="footnotetagxi3" name="footnotetagxi3"></a><a href="#footnotexi3"><sup>3</sup></a>, however, that the first part "deals with
Hjalmar's youth, the counsel given him by his father
when he leaves home, how he is taken into the
retinue (<i>hirð</i>) of the Swedish King, how he distinguishes
himself by his bravery against the vikings,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page195" id="page195"></a>[pg 195]</span>
and how he and Asbjörn and Örvarodd swear to be
foster-brothers."</p>

<p>The translation which follows is made from Hammershaimb's
second edition of the ballad, published
in <i>Nordiske Oldskrifter</i>, vols. 18 and 19, Part II<a id="footnotetagxi4" name="footnotetagxi4"></a><a href="#footnotexi4"><sup>4</sup></a>&mdash;which
is in fact Svabo's text; but the refrain of his
first version has been adopted.</p>

<p>It will be noticed that the ballad differs in many
points from the <i>Saga of Hervör and Heithrek</i>. In the
first place, according to the ballad, it is Arngrim and
not Angantyr who is buried with the sword Tyrfing<a id="footnotetagxi5" name="footnotetagxi5"></a><a href="#footnotexi5"><sup>5</sup></a>.
Secondly, Hervik (the Hervör of the Saga) is
described as a daughter of Arngrim and a sister of
Angantyr. Hjalmar also is a brother of Hervik and
of Angantyr according to the ballad, and actually
accompanies Hervik on her quest of the sword
Tyrfing, which according to the ballad took place
<i>before</i> the fight on Samsø. Finally, Arngrim is said
to have been killed by Örvarodd, and Hervik
accordingly kills Örvarodd in retaliation. Another
'Young Odd' appears later as Hjalmar's companion
in the true place of Örvarodd.</p>

<p>Thus we see that, as commonly happens in popular
poetry, complex situations have become simplified,
and, where simplification has not taken place, the
people and events have become confused<a id="footnotetagxi6" name="footnotetagxi6"></a><a href="#footnotexi6"><sup>6</sup></a>. Both in
the shorter Faroese ballad of <i>Hjalmar and Angantyr</i>,
and in the Danish ballad of <i>Angelfyr and Helmer the</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page196" id="page196"></a>[pg 196]</span>
<i>Warrior</i>, the simplification has proceeded even farther,
and a still more striking instance of rigorous simplification
is to be found in the <i>Ballad of Nornagest</i>.</p>

<p>No <i>Rímur</i> dealing with Arngrim's Sons have been
published, and I have not been able to ascertain
whether any exist, though a passing mention is made
of them in verse 74 of the satirical poem <i>Skítharíma</i><a id="footnotetagxi7" name="footnotetagxi7"></a><a href="#footnotexi7"><sup>7</sup></a>,
probably composed in the fifteenth century by Einar
or Sigurður Fóstri. <i>A priori</i> it would seem probable
that the ballads are derived from compositions of
this kind rather than from the Saga direct. But it
would be unwise to hazard even a guess as to the
balance of probability without detailed knowledge of
the relative circulation, distribution and popularity
of the Sagas and the Rímur respectively.</p>

<p>The air to which the following ballad is sung on
the Faroes has been transcribed and printed by
Thuren in <i>Folkesangen paa Færøerne</i>, pp. 132, 133.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="footnotexi1" name="footnotexi1"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnotetagxi1">Footnote 1:</a>
Cf. also the introduction of Örvar-Odd in v. 29 of Hammershaimb's version (<i>Antiq. Tídss.</i>, 1849-51, pp. 61-74); also vv. 28, 33, 58.</p>

<h3 style="margin-top: 3em;">INTRODUCTION TO THE FAROESE RIDDLE BALLAD (GÁTU RÍMA)</h3>

<p>The <i>Gátu Ríma</i> was first taken down in Suderø by
a clergyman, Schröter, early in the nineteenth century,
and is preserved in the archives of the Early Text
Society in Copenhagen. Unfortunately Schröter was
only able to obtain the Ballad in a fragmentary form,
and he has left us only a Danish translation of what
he found. In his travels on the Faroes in 1847-1848
Hammershaimb made strenuous efforts to get the
entire version, but curiously enough only succeeded
in getting a version (of course in the original
Faroese) which corresponds closely in length and
content with Schröter's. He published this version
first in the <i>Antiquarisk Tídsskrift</i>, 1849-1851, and
later <i>Færöiske Kvæðer</i>, vol. <span class="sc">ii</span>. (Copenhagen, 1855).
The translation given below is taken from the ballad
as printed in <i>Færöiske Kvæðer</i>.</p>

<p>That a longer version of this ballad once existed
is proved by the fact that verse 8 of both Schröter's
and Hammershaimb's versions states that Guest the
Blind<a id="footnotetagxii1" name="footnotetagxii1"></a><a href="#footnotexii1"><sup>1</sup></a> propounds thirty riddles to King Heithrek&mdash;about
the same number as are to be found in the Saga,
though only some six riddles and the answers to
four others have come down to us. Hammershaimb
attributed the loss of the others to the fact that the
ballad is no longer one of those used in the dance.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page213" id="page213"></a>[pg 213]</span>
He was of opinion that the riddles propounded in the
<i>Ríma</i> are not the same as those found in the Saga;
but it is to be noticed that the subjects of the riddles
are in four cases the same, and in the other cases the
subjects have the same characteristics, though the
riddles themselves are not identical. It would therefore
seem on the whole that the subjects of the <i>Gátu
Ríma</i> were originally identical with those of the Saga,
but that they have become corrupted and possibly
confused in the popular mind.</p>

<h3 style="margin-top: 3em;">INTRODUCTION TO THE SHETLAND BALLAD OF HILDINA</h3>

<p>This ballad has been discussed above, pp. 39 and
164 f. It was taken down by George Low in the
course of a visit made by him to the island of Foula
in the Shetlands in 1774. He was entirely ignorant
of the language, and had apparently no idea as to
the meaning of the actual words, though the general
drift of the ballad was explained to him by the
islander, William Henry, from whom he obtained it
(cf. p. 164). As very few remains of the dialect have
been preserved, apart from the ballad, the interpretation
presents great difficulties. The following
translation of the first twelve stanzas is made from
the corrected text given by Dr M. Hægstad in his
edition of the <i>Hildina</i> contained in <i>Skrifter udgivne
af Videnskabsselskabet i Christiania</i>, 1900 (<i>Historisk-Filosofiske
Klasse</i>, <span class="sc">ii</span>).</p>

  </div>  </div>

<p>It will be seen that up to this point, in spite of the
loss of the names, there can be little doubt that the
subject of the ballad is the story of Hethin and Högni.
After this however the narrative deviates from any
other known version of this story. It would rather
seem that&mdash;as in the German Kudrun&mdash;two stories,
originally distinct, have been brought together in
one poem.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 3em;">THE THÁTTR OF NORNAGEST<a href="#n"><sub>°</sub></a></h4>

<p><i>The Tháttr of Nornagest.</i> A <i>tháttr</i> is a portion (episode)
of a longer saga, in this case the <i>Saga of Olaf Tryggvason</i>
which is found in the <i>Flateyjarbók</i>.</p>

<a name="nn1" id="nn1"></a>
<p class="indent">I.<a href="#n1"><sub>°</sub></a> <i>King Olaf Tryggvason</i>, one of the most famous kings of
Norway (<i>r.</i> 995-1000). He compelled the country to accept
Christianity. For accounts of his life and times, see the
<i>Story of Olaf Tryggvison</i> in the <i>Heimskringla</i>, vol. <span class="sc">i</span>, pp.
221-378;
and also the longer <i>Saga of King Olaf Tryggwason</i>,
translated by Sephton.</p>

<p><i>Trondhjem</i>, originally the name, not of a town, but of the
entire district round the Trondhjem Fjord.</p>

<p><i>A man came to him.</i> Cf. the <i>Saga of Olaf Tryggvason</i>
(<i>Heimskringla</i>), ch. 71.</p>

<p><i>Guest.</i> Here a pun is intended, the word <i>Gestr</i> in Icelandic
signifying a 'guest' as well as a 'stranger.'</p>

<p><i>The Contentious.</i> The word in the text, '<i>þingbítr</i>,' seems
to mean 'sharp in debate,' and to refer to his ready wit and
astuteness in litigation.</p>

<p><i>Guest said that he had been prime-signed.</i> To 'prime-sign'
signified to make the <i>prima signatio</i> or sign of the Cross
over a person, preliminary to baptism. People so 'prime-signed'
were admitted to certain parts of the Mass and to
social intercourse in Christian communities. See the <i>Saga
of Egil Skallagrimsson</i>, ch. 50 "King Athelstan [of England]
was a good Christian.... He asked Thorolf and his brother to
let themselves be prime-signed; for this was a common
practice with both merchants and soldiers who took service
under Christians. Men who were prime-signed had free
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page221" id="page221"></a>[pg 221]</span>
intercourse with both Christians and heathens, and followed
whatever religion they liked best. Thorolf and Egil did as
the King asked them, and both were prime-signed."</p>

<p><i>Svein Forkbeard</i>, King of Denmark from 986 (?) to 1014,
and of England also during the last year of his life.</p>

<p><i>The Emperor Otto</i>, i.e. Otto II, 973-983.</p>

<p><i>Dane-work</i>, i.e. the Danish Wall still partially preserved,
which divided Jutland from the land of the Saxons and
stretched from near the city of Slesvig to the marsh-land
along the River Treene.</p>

<p><i>King Harold Gormsson</i> appears to have reigned for about
fifty years and to have died probably in 986. He was
nick-named Harold 'Bluetooth' (or perhaps 'Blacktooth').
About 974 he fought the Emperor Otto II, and Earl Haakon
of Norway aided him. Both Harold and Haakon were forced
to accept Christianity, but Haakon afterwards renounced it.</p>

<p><i>Earl Haakon the Heathen</i>, i.e. Earl Haakon the Great, or
the Bad, who ruled over Norway, 975-995.</p>

<p><i>Guthmund.</i> Cf. the <i>Saga of Hervör and Heithrek</i>, ch. 1.
See also Saxo Grammaticus, <i>Dan. Hist.</i>, pp. 346-349, where
Guthmund is described as a magician dwelling in the land
of the Perms. But see <i>Glasisvellir</i>, below.</p>

<p><i>Glasisvellir.</i> Cf. the <i>Saga of Hervör and Heithrek</i>, ch. 1.
For the name of the tree or grove called <i>Glasir</i> beside Othin's
abode in Valhalla, see <i>Skáldskaparmál</i>, ch. 34: "Glasir
stands with golden foliage before the halls of the God of
Victory." See also <i>Bjarkamál in Forna</i>, str. 3.</p>

<a name="nn2" id="nn2"></a>
<p class="indent">II.<a href="#n2"><sub>°</sub></a> <i>Ulf the Red</i> was standard-bearer to Olaf Tryggvason
at the Battle of Svöld (cf. the <i>Saga of Olaf Tryggvason,
Heimskringla</i>, ch. 56), where he slew great numbers of the
enemy.</p>

<p><i>The Bay</i>, i.e. Christiania Fjord and the adjacent coasts.</p>

<p><i>King Half.</i> See <i>Hálfssaga</i>, ch. 10; and <i>Flateyjarbók</i>, 11,
pp. 136, 137. King Half had a chosen band of warriors
numbering about sixty, who were subject to strict discipline
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page222" id="page222"></a>[pg 222]</span>
and rules which Professor Craigie (<i>The Icelandic Sagas</i>, p. 94)
suggests were modelled on those of the Jómsvíkings. For
instance, "It was one of their customs always to lie off the
ends of promontories. Secondly, they made a rule of never
pitching tents on their ships and never clewing up the sail
on account of bad weather." The incident referred to in the
text is not mentioned in the Saga.</p>

<p><i>No halls had been built in Norway.</i> The writer probably
means to contrast the stone halls of his own day with the
wooden structures of earlier times.</p>

<p><i>The Harping of Gunnar</i>, a lost poem. The legend here
referred to is told in <i>Völsunga Saga</i>, ch. 37 (and elsewhere),
doubtless from an old lay.&mdash;'King Attila had Gunnar cast
into a pit full of snakes ... and his hands were tied. Guthrún
sent him a harp, and he was so skilful in harping that he could
play it with his toes; and he harped so well that hardly anyone
had ever heard such skilful playing, even with the hand. So
beautifully did he play that all the snakes were lulled to sleep
except one horrible big adder which crept up to him and
stung him to the heart. Thus he perished with great
courage.'</p>

<p>Gunnar, the son of Gjúki, is the central figure both of
the Norse story and of the German <i>Nibelungenlied</i>, in which
he is called Gunther. In reality, he was overthrown and
killed by the Huns in 437, after which the Burgundians
moved from the Rhine to the district now known as Burgundy.</p>

<p><i>The Ancient Wiles of Guthrún.</i> It is generally believed
that this is the name of another lost heroic poem. But the
title may possibly mean <i>The Adventures of Guthrún</i>, in which
case the poem referred to may be the well-known <i>Ancient Lay
of Guthrún</i> (<i>Guðrúnarkviða hin forna</i>). This latter poem is
alluded to in ch. 9 below under the title of <i>Guðrúnarræða</i>.</p>

<p><i>Sigurth the son of Sigmund.</i> The story of Sigurth the
Völsung is related in <i>Völsunga Saga</i>.</p>

<p><i>Hundingsbani</i>, i.e. 'Slayer of Hunding.' See <i>Völsunga
Saga</i>, ch. 9.</p>

<a name="nn5" id="nn5"></a>
<p class="indent">V.<a href="#n5"><sub>°</sub></a> <i>It chanced one day that</i>, etc. Chapters 5 and 6 are mainly
taken from the poem <i>Reginsmál</i> of which strophes 13-26
are quoted in our text. <i>Reginsmál</i> is the first poem of a trilogy
dealing with the early adventures of Sigurth. The two remaining
poems <i>Fáfnismál</i> and <i>Sigrdrifumál</i> are used only in
the last two sentences of ch. 6.</p>

<p><i>Yngvi</i> is a name of the god Frey, from whom the kings of
Norway and the early kings of Sweden were believed to have
sprung.</p>

<p><i>Fafnisbani</i>, i.e. 'Slayer of Fafnir.' Cf. ch. 6 <i>infra</i>. See
also <i>Völsunga Saga</i>, ch. 18.</p>

<p><i>The Imperial Power had not</i>, etc. This may mean either
the refounding of the Western Empire by Charlemagne,
<span class="sc">a.d.</span> 800, or possibly the gaining of the Imperial throne by
Otto I, King of the Germans, in 962.</p>

<a name="nn6" id="nn6"></a>
<p class="indent">VI.<a href="#n6"><sub>°</sub></a> <i>Sigurth prepared for battle</i>, etc. An account of this
battle is given in <i>Völsunga Saga</i>, ch. 17.</p>

<p><i>The sea-king's steed.</i> The text has <i>Ræfils hestum</i>, lit.
'Ræfil's horses.' Ræfil was a legendary sea-king. The
names of such characters are frequently used in 'kennings'
(i.e. poetic circumlocutions) like this.</p>

<p><i>Hnikar</i>, a name of the god Othin in the <i>Grímnismál</i>
(str. 47) and elsewhere.</p>

<p><i>The Moon's sister.</i> The text has <i>systur Mána</i>, 'Máni's
sister,' i.e. the sun. <i>Máni</i>, the old word for the moon, is
preserved in Iceland only in a mythological sense, the ordinary
word in use for moon being <i>tungl</i>. <i>Máni</i> and <i>Sól</i> (the sun)
were brother and sister. See <i>Vafþrúþnismál</i>, str. 23; also
<i>Gylfaginning</i>, ch. 11, 12.</p>

<p><i>Order their array</i>, lit. 'draw up a wedge-shaped column'&mdash;a
favourite battle-formation, the origin of which was
ascribed to Othin.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page224" id="page224"></a>[pg 224]</span>
<i>Stumbling is bad luck</i>, etc. So Wilken (gloss. <i>s.v. fyrir</i>,

one's luck.'</p>

<p><i>Friesland.</i> In early times the Frisians occupied a much
greater extent of coast than now, reaching from the boundary
between Holland and Belgium on one side to beyond the
mouth of the Weser on the other&mdash;apart from the Frisians
inhabiting the west coast of Slesvig.</p>

<p><i>The 'blood-eagle'</i> was a form of vengeance practised by
the heathen Scandinavians in battle when anyone captured
the slayer of his father. The ribs were cut in the shape of
an eagle, and the lungs torn out through the opening. The
Northumbrian King Ella (Ælla) is said to have been put to
death in this way by the sons of Ragnar Lothbrók. Cf. the
<i>Saga of Ragnar Loðbrók and his sons</i>, ch. 18; also the <i>Tháttr
of Ragnar's Sons</i>, ch. 3.</p>

<p><i>The story of Sigurth Fafnisbani.</i> The whole story of the
loves of Sigurth and Brynhild is related in the <i>Völsunga Saga</i>,

from historical sources; but he is mentioned in <i>Skáldskaparmál</i>,
ch. 41, <i>Völsunga Saga</i> ch. 25, and in the <i>Edda Poems</i>, as the
father of Gunnar and Guthrún. His name appears also (as
<i>Gifica</i>, <i>Gibicho</i>, etc.) in the Anglo-Saxon poem <i>Widsiþ</i>, the
Latin poem <i>Waltharius</i>, and in several early German poems.</p>

<p><i>Sigurth Hring</i>, a legendary king of Sweden and Denmark,
and the father of Ragnar Loðbrók. His story is related at
length in a fragment of the <i>Skjöldunga Saga</i>; and he is probably
identical with the <i>Sigifridus</i> who is mentioned in several
Frankish Chronicles under the year 812 as carrying on
hostilities against another Danish King <i>Anulo</i>.</p>

<p><i>Jarnamotha.</i> The locality is unknown. There were large
forests in Holstein in the Middle Ages called 'Iarnawith' and
'Isarnho'; cf. Müllenhoff, <i>Deutsche Altertumskunde</i>, v, p. 122.</p>

<p><i>hazlewood poles had been set up</i>, etc. The verb <i>hasla</i>, used
in the sense of 'to challenge (to a pitched battle),' means, lit.
'to enhazle' a battlefield, i.e. to mark out the space reserved
for a pitched battle with hazel poles. Cf. the <i>Saga of Egil
Skallagrímsson</i>, ch. 52.</p>

<p><i>The Kurir</i> were the people of Courland (perhaps Lithuanians).
The <i>Kvænir</i> were the Finnish inhabitants of the
northern portion of what is now Sweden. King Alfred, in
his translation of <i>Orosius</i>, inserts an original account of Norway
and the neighbouring regions which was given to him
by a Norwegian called Ohthere. It is there stated that beyond
the mountains which bound the northern part of Norway was
'the land of the Cwenas.' Cf. also the <i>Saga of Egil Skallagrímsson</i>,
ch. 14.</p>

<p><i>Starkath</i>, the ideal warrior of old time in the North.
Probably originally a historical figure, he became the centre
of much legendary matter, and, as often happened in such
cases, he was even credited with the composition of many
poems, notably that on the Battle of Brávöll&mdash;an event which
probably took place long after his time. In Saxo Grammaticus,
<i>Dan. Hist.</i>, pp. 246-258, he corresponds to the unnamed
"Old Warrior" mentioned in <i>Beowulf</i>, l. 2041 ff.</p>

<p><i>Fenhring</i>, in Hörthaland in Norway, not far from Bergen.</p>

in early times to Denmark.</p>

<p class="indent">VIII.<a href="#n8"><sub>°</sub></a> <i>Starkath had committed a foul murder.</i> For this story
see Saxo Grammaticus, <i>Dan. Hist.</i>, p. 314 ff. Saxo says that the
rule of King Ali or Ole was so hateful to the Zealanders that
twelve of their generals resolved to put him to death, bribing
Starkath to join them. Although a personal friend of Ole,
Starkath agreed to do so, and murdered him in his bath. He
afterwards repented bitterly, "and to atone for his crime slew
some of those who had inspired him to it."</p>

<p><i>Travels.</i> I have followed the reading <i>ferða</i>, 'travels,'
adopted by Wilken, not <i>frænda</i>, as in the <i>Fornaldar Sögur</i>, ed.

him to tell him much more about the history of his relatives."</p>

<p><i>From the Land of the Romans</i>, lit. 'From Valland'&mdash;the
'land of the Valar,' i.e. the Celts or Romans. Here the

of the Rhine. In the <i>Nibelungenlied</i>, Gunther (i.e. Gunnar)
is represented as reigning at Worms. Cf. p. 232 below.</p>

<p><i>Assigned me a home</i>, etc. In the <i>Codex Regius</i> of the <i>Edda

had my swan-form and those of my eight sisters carried
beneath an oak."</p>

<p><i>Hjalmgunnar.</i> See <i>Sigrdrifumál</i>, the prose following str. 4.
"She (i.e. Sigrdrifa) said that two kings were fighting. One
was called Hjalmgunnar. He was old at that time, but a
very great warrior, and Othin had promised him victory; but
the other was called Agnar, the brother of Autha, whom no

Hjalmgunnar in battle, but Othin pierced her with a sleep-producing
thorn in punishment for this," etc.</p>

<p><i>Fafnir</i> was the serpent who guarded the gold hoard on
Gnítaheið till Sigurth slew him and carried off the treasure.</p>

<p><i>All too long</i>, etc. In the <i>Codex Regius</i> of the <i>Edda Poems</i>
this passage runs as follows: "For far too long a time (? for
ever) will women and men be born into the world to overwhelming
sorrow."</p>

<p><i>The Sons of Lothbrok.</i> Ragnar Lothbrók was a famous king
who flourished about the middle of the ninth century, and
who, according to legend, obtained his name ('Shaggy
Breeks') from the shaggy trowsers which he wore when he
went to attack a serpent. His various exploits are told in the
<i>Saga of Ragnar Lothbrók</i>, and in the <i>Tháttr of the Sons of
Ragnar</i>, and also by Saxo Grammaticus, <i>Dan. Hist.</i>, pp. 368-380,
etc. Among his other adventures he is said to have
invaded Northumbria, but he was defeated by King Ella
(Ælla) and thrown into a snake-pit, where he "died laughing,"
as we are told in a late poem (<i>Krakumál</i> or the 'Death-song
of Ragnar Lothbrók'). His death was afterwards avenged by
his sons who invaded England in 866. Practically nothing
historical is known of Loðbrók himself, though the achievements
of his sons, both in the British Isles and on the continent,
are of great historical importance.</p>

<p><i>In the neighbourhood of the Alps.</i> In 856, Björn Ironside,
a son of Ragnar Lothbrók, with Hástein his chief lieutenant,
invaded France, and during the years 859-862 made expeditions
to Spain, Africa, the south of France, and Italy,
capturing Pisa, Luna, etc. There can be no doubt that in
their invasion of Italy in 860 the real objective was Rome;
but for some unknown reason they returned without approaching
it. According to Scandinavian tradition, when they
entered Luna they were under the impression that it was
Rome, and returned satisfied that their aim was accomplished.</p>

<p><i>Vifilsborg.</i> This place is identified by Wilken with the
modern Avenches in the Canton Vaud (Switzerland).</p>

<p><i>Upsala</i>, i.e. Old Upsala, the ancient capital of the Swedish
kingdom, a few miles from the modern city.</p>

<p><i>King Harold the Fairhaired</i>, said to have been born <i>c.</i> 850
and to have succeeded as King of Vestfold <i>c.</i> 860. His conquest
of Norway was practically completed at the Battle of

were represented in Scandinavian mythology as women with
the power of shaping human destiny. See <i>Helgakviða Hundingsbana</i>,

Similar beliefs occur in Greek stories about the Fates (<ins title="Greek: Klôthes">&#922;&#955;&#x1f65;&#952;&#949;&#962;</ins>)

the fork (delta) of a river.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page229" id="page229"></a>[pg 229]</span>

<p><i>Æsir and Vanir</i>, two sets of Scandinavian deities; but the
references to the River Don and Asia are due to the learned
speculations of later times, suggested partly by the resemblance
of <i>Asia</i> and <i>Æsir</i>. According to <i>Ynglingasaga</i>, chs. 1-4,
there was war between the Æsir and the Vanir, which was concluded
by an exchange of hostages. The Vanir gave to the Æsir three
of their leading people&mdash;Njörth and his children Frey and
Freyja. Othin made Njörth and Frey temple-priests, and
Freyja a temple-priestess. What is said about Freyja here is not
mentioned in <i>Ynglingasaga</i>; but from the poems of the <i>Edda</i> it
is clear that she was the Aphrodite of northern mythology.</p>

<p class="indent">I. <i>Gnothar-Asmund</i>, i.e. Asmund of the Gnoth, who was so
called from his ship 'Gnoth' (cf. p. 230 above). For an
account of him see the <i>Saga of Egil and Asmund</i> (in <i>Fornaldar
Sögur</i>, vol. <span class="sc">iii</span>), especially ch. 17. He is mentioned also in
the <i>Saga of Grím Loðinkinni</i>, ch. 2. A different account of
Olaf's family is given in <i>Göngu-Hrólfs Saga</i>, ch. 38.</p>

<p><i>Garthar in Denmark.</i> The geography of the story is by
no means clear. Elsewhere in this saga Olaf's realm would
seem to be situated in Sweden, while references in other
works, e.g. <i>Landnámabók</i>, <span class="sc">i</span>, ch. 3, <i>Hversu Noregr
Bygthist</i>,
ch. 2 (<i>Fornaldar Sögur</i>, <span class="sc">ii</span>, p. 7) etc., point to Norway,
especially
the provinces of Thelamörk and Hörthaland, as the
home of Hromund and his family.</p>

<p><i>Hromund.</i> According to <i>Landnámabók</i>, <span class="sc">i</span>, ch. 3, Ingolf
and Leif, the first settlers in Iceland (<span class="sc">a.d.</span> 874) were the
great grandsons of Hromund Greipsson. This would seem to

<p><i>Scoundrels.</i> The text has <i>Blámenn</i>, i.e. lit. 'Black men',
negroes. But in the Romantic Sagas, owing probably to the
influence of stories relating to the Saracens, pirates are
described as <i>Blámenn</i>, even in stories relating exclusively to
the North. Cf. <i>The Ballad of Hjálmar and Angantyr</i> (refrain),

says that she will have no supper till she "sup with Freyja."</p>

<p><i>No blade would wound Hröngvith.</i> It is not uncommon to
hear that a warrior, usually an unsympathetic character, was
immune through spells from wounds inflicted by weapons;

<p><i>Ghosts.</i> It will be seen from the context that the word

<p><i>Tyrfing.</i> It has been suggested that this name is derived
from <i>tyrfi</i>, 'resinous fir-tree,' owing to its flaming like
resinous fir-wood. In early times it was customary for swords
to be called by names ending in <i>-ing</i>. Cf. the swords <i>Hrunting</i>

<p><i>Perms.</i> The text has <i>um Bjarmaland</i> 'in the land of the
Bjarmar,' i.e. the <i>Beormas</i> of Ohthere's Voyage in Alfred's
translation of <i>Orosius</i>. It is generally reached, not as here,
apparently, by the Baltic, but by voyages round the North
Cape. The name is generally supposed to be connected with
<i>Perm</i>, and in early times may have comprehended the
Zyrianians, as well as the Permians proper and the Votiaks.
There is some evidence from place-names that this group
of languages was once spoken as far west as the White Sea.

<p><i>Sprinkled with water.</i> Sprinkling a child with water when
a name was given to it appears to have been customary in
heathen times. Cf. the <i>Saga of Harold the Fairhaired</i>
(<i>Heimskringla</i>), ch. 40; the <i>Saga of Haakon the Good</i>, ch. 12;
the <i>Saga of Egil Skallagrimsson</i>, ch. 31; <i>Völsunga Saga</i>,

<p><i>She grew up</i>, etc. Cf. the description of the later Hervör

the Saga in its present form. Heusler (<i>Eddica Minora</i>, p. xxi)
refers it to the early part of the twelfth century.</p>

<p><i>I will give you my necklace</i>, etc. Note the discrepancy
between the poem and the prose at this point. In the former
it would seem to be Hervör who offers a necklace, and this
is what we should expect.</p>

<p><i>Foolish is he who comes here alone</i>, etc. Cf. J. M. Synge,
<i>The Aran Islands</i>, <span class="sc">iii</span>: "We went up on the dun, where

<p><i>Reithgotaland</i> is here explained as Jutland; but in ch. 9,
Heithrek's subjects are described as <i>Gotar</i>, i.e. Goths; and
in the latter part of the Saga, from ch. 12 onwards, the
subject is clearly a war between the Goths and Huns. The
earliest occurrence of the word (in the Swedish Inscription of
Rök; cf. also <i>Vafþrúþnismál</i>, str. 12) gives not <i>Reithgotaland</i>,
but <i>Hraithgotaland</i>, which suggests that the name may be
connected in some way with <i>Hrethgotan</i>, a name applied to
the Goths in Anglo-Saxon poetry.</p>

<p><i>Hall of the Dís.</i> It is not clear who the <i>dís</i> was, as the
word is used rather loosely for supernatural female beings.
Another reference to the <i>Hall of the Dís</i> occurs in <i>Ynglingasaga</i>,
ch. 33. One of the goddesses (Freyja?) may be meant;
or it may be the guardian spirit of the family.</p>

<p><i>Sifka and Hlöth.</i> The names here mentioned, together with

in <i>Widsiþ</i>, l. 116, where we find</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p><i>Heaðoric and Sifecan, Hliðe and Incgenðeow</i>,</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>mentioned as being among the followers of Eormenric. These
names clearly come from Gothic tradition, but the passage
would seem to suggest that <i>Sifeca</i> was a man, the Sibich of the
German poems. Cf. Chambers, <i>Widsith</i>, p. 32. For the
name Lotherus in Saxo, see note to ch. 12, p. 242.</p>

<p class="indent">IX.<a href="#hh9"><sub>°</sub></a> <i>Wendland</i>, i.e. the 'Land of the Slavs' (Anglo-Saxon
<i>Weonodland</i>). After the expansion of the Slavs, from the
fifth century onwards, this term came to denote an enormous
expanse of country, including the coast of Eastern Germany,
to which it is applied in the account of the voyage of Wulfstan
in Alfred's translation of <i>Orosius</i>. In earlier times, when the
Goths still occupied Poland and Galicia, the Slavs were
restricted to the regions east of these countries.</p>

<p><i>His horse fell dead.</i> Here the point of the story seems to be
missed, or at least not clearly expressed. According to Höfund's
fifth maxim (see ch. 6), Heithrek was not to ride his best
horse when he was in a hurry.</p>

<a name="nhh10" id="nhh10"></a>
<p class="indent">X.<a href="#hh10"><sub>°</sub></a> <i>They had a daughter.</i> From our text it would appear that
Hervör was the daughter of Sifka; but the end of ch. 9 is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page239" id="page239"></a>[pg 239]</span>
probably a late addition to the text. In the text printed
by Rafn, Hervör is expressly stated to be a daughter of
Hergerth.</p>

<p><i>Ormar</i> is presumably to be identified with the <i>Wyrmhere</i>
mentioned in <i>Widsiþ</i>, l. 119, in connection with the war
waged by the Goths against the Huns in defence of their
ancient fatherland, round the forest of the Vistula.</p>

<p><i>Gestumblindi.</i> For this curious name, cf. the <i>Gestiblindus
Gothorum rex</i> mentioned by Saxo Grammaticus, <i>Dan. Hist.</i>,
p. 198 ff.</p>

<p><i>In the King's retinue there were seven men</i>, etc. In the text
(<i>a</i>) of this saga printed in Rafn's edition (<i>Fornaldar Sögur</i>,
<span class="sc">i</span>, p. 462), there are said to be twelve men here. This is no
doubt the right figure, twelve being the regular number in
the judicial councils of the North, whether historical or
legendary. Thus, e.g. in the <i>Saga of Olaf the Holy</i> (<i>Heimskringla</i>),
ch. 96 we read of a council of twelve sages (<i>spekingar</i>),
whose duty it was to advise the Swedish king, especially in
the administration of justice. Similar councils existed in the
Danish settlements in England. Thus Lincoln and Stamford
had each a council of twelve (cf. Stubbs, <i>Const. Hist.</i>, <span class="sc">i</span>,
p. 106, and n. 4). We may compare the twelve priests who
officiated in the sacrifices at Mæren (cf. the <i>Saga of Olaf
the Holy, Heimskr</i>. ch. 115), and the story of the twelve gods
who were appointed by Othin as temple priests (<i>hof-goðar</i>)
to keep up the sacrifices and administer justice among men;
cf. <i>Ynglingasaga</i>, ch. 2 (<i>Hyndluljóð</i>, str. 30; <i>Gautrekssaga</i>,
ch. 7). In the Irish <i>Lay of Magnus Barelegs</i>, the Norwegians
are referred to as <i>Clann an dá &#267;o<span style="font-size: 0.9em;">&#7745;</span>airlea&#267; déag</i> ('children or
clan of the twelve councillors'). Cf. <i>Laoi<span style="font-size: 0.9em;">&#7691;</span> Ma&#289;nius Moir</i>
(<i>Reliques of Irish Poetry</i>, by Charlotte Brooke, Dublin
1789, p. 274).</p>

<p><i>King Heithrek worshipped Frey.</i> One text quoted by Rafn
(<i>Verelius</i>) has <i>Freyja</i> for <i>Frey</i>. The boar appears in stories
relating to both these deities, e.g. <i>Gylfaginning</i>, ch. 49;

<i>Modern Language Notes</i>, 18, p. 103; <i>The Riddles of the

verse, while the King's answers, except the refrain with which
they begin ("Your riddle is a good one," etc.) are in prose.</p>

<p><i>You went over a bridge</i>, etc. The metrical text given by
Rafn (<i>Fornaldar Sögur</i>, <span class="sc">i</span>, p. 466), has: "A bird flew above
thee, a fish swam beneath thee, thou did'st go over a bridge."
The prose text given on the same page has: "Thou did'st
go over a bridge, and the course of the river was beneath thee,
but birds were flying over thy head and on both sides of thee,
and that was their road."</p>

<p><i>Delling's doorway.</i> Delling (perhaps from an obsolete word
<i>dallr</i>, 'bright, shining') is mentioned in <i>Vafþrúþnismál</i>,
str. 25, as the 'father of Day.' Possibly he may originally
have been a personification of day itself. The expression
"before Delling's doorway" occurs also in <i>Hávamál</i>, str. 160,
where it has been thought to mean 'at sunrise.' See also the
genealogy in <i>Hversu Noregr Bygðist</i>, ch. <span class="sc">i</span> (<i>Fornaldar
Sögur</i>,
<span class="sc">ii</span>, p. 6), where a certain Svanhild is said to be the daughter of
Day, the son of Delling, and of Sól (i.e. the sun), the daughter
of Mundilfari (cf. <i>Gylfaginning</i>, ch. <span class="sc">ii</span>).</p>

<p><i>Wolves are always struggling for it.</i> See <i>Gylfaginning</i>,
ch. 12 (from <i>Grímnismál</i>, str. 39).</p>

<p><i>He who made it</i>, etc. I have followed Heusler's reading
and read <i>er</i> for <i>ker</i> and <i>þó</i> or <i>sjá</i> for <i>þá</i>.</p>

<p><i>Laying their eggs.</i> For <i>verja</i> read <i>verpa</i>.</p>

<p><i>Have no husbands.</i> For <i>eigu</i>, read <i>eigut</i>, as on p. 121.</p>

<p><i>Game of chess.</i> The text has <i>hneftafl</i>, i.e. a game having
certain features in common with chess which was played in
Iceland till the introduction of the latter, probably in the
thirteenth century. Game-pieces have been discovered in
Iceland which were probably used for this game. Some are
plain and hemispherical in shape, others are shaped with a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page241" id="page241"></a>[pg 241]</span>
man's head or a dog's head. For a full and interesting description
of <i>hneftafl</i> see H. J. R. Murray, <i>A History of Chess</i>,
Oxford, 1913, Appendix I, 'Chess in Iceland,' pp. 443-446.</p>

<p><i>Ægis meyjar.</i> Ægir or Hlér, the husband of Rann, is
a personification of the sea; but the kennings 'Ægir's
daughters,' 'Ægir's steed,' etc. for 'billows' are common in
poetry. See <i>Helgakviða Hundingsbana</i> <span class="sc">ii</span>, str. 29, and
<i>Bragar-ræður</i>,
ch. 55 (included in Brodeur's translation of the <i>Prose
Edda</i> as <i>Skáldskaparmál</i>, ch. <span class="sc">i</span>).</p>

<p><i>Reefs.</i> For <i>brimserkum</i>, read <i>brimskerjum</i>.</p>

<p><i>Ocean-path.</i> For <i>brim-reiðar</i>, read <i>brim-leiðar</i>. The
passage is possibly corrupt.</p>

<p><i>That is the hunn.</i> This stanza is difficult to interpret as
we have no clear information as to the character of the game.
It would seem that like the game of the Welsh <i>tawlbwrdd</i>,
it was played between sides composed, the one of sixteen
'fair' (white) men, the other of a King (called <i>hnefa</i> or <i>hunn</i>)
and eight 'dark' (black) men. Cf. note to <i>Game of Chess</i>
above. See also Murray, <i>A History of Chess</i>, Oxford 1913,
Appendix I, 'Chess in Iceland,' pp. 443-446.</p>

<p><i>Four walking</i>, etc. This riddle is found in a form almost
identical with our text in Jakobsen's <i>Dialect and Place
Names of Shetland</i> (Lerwick, 1897), p. 53. The 'sow' is
also found in the <i>Exeter Book</i>, while 'the waves,' 'the
anchor' and 'hailstones' have certain affinities with the AS.
riddles.</p>

<p><i>King Itrek's Game.</i> The reference here seems to be to a
game something like chess. The text (R) given by Heusler in
his edition of the <i>Eddica Minora</i>, p. 118, reads: "That is
Itrek and Andath when they sit at their game."</p>

<p><i>Dead men</i>, etc. In this strophe there seems to be an
elaborate play on words. The phrase 'dead men' (<i>dauðar
menn</i>) seems to be a disguise for <i>val</i> which means 'the slain'
as well as 'hawk.' So also 'channel of blood' seems to be a
disguise for <i>æði</i> which means 'vein' as well as 'eider-duck.'</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page242" id="page242"></a>[pg 242]</span>

<p><i>Sleipnir.</i> Othin's eight-footed horse. Cf. especially <i>Gylfaginning</i>,

<p><i>Tell me lastly</i>, etc. In <i>Vafþrúþnismál</i>, str. 54, Othin makes
himself known to Vafþrúþnir by the same question.</p>

<p><i>Humli and Hlöth.</i> These names may be compared with
<i>Humblus</i> and <i>Lotherus</i>, two sons of Dan, the first kings
mentioned in Saxo Grammaticus, <i>Dan. Hist.</i>, p. 1. For the

<i>Atlakviða</i>, str. 3, 5, and 13; and in <i>Helgakviða Hundingsbana</i>,
<span class="sc">i</span>, str. 53.</p>

<p><i>Pillar</i>, lit. 'stone.' I do not know what is meant. Possibly
<i>Guðrúnarkviða</i> <span class="sc">iii</span>, str. 3 may be compared.</p>

<p><i>Danaper's Shore.</i> <i>Danpr</i> is treated as a personal name in
<i>Rígsþula</i>, str. 49, but it is more likely to have been originally
the name of the River Dnieper (mentioned by Jordanes, <i>The
Origins and Deeds of the Goths</i>, ch. 5, 52, as <i>Danaper</i>), which
was within the territories of the Goths in the fourth century.</p>

<p><i>Battle of Brávöll.</i> The chief accounts of this battle are to
be found in the second fragment of the <i>Skjöldunga Saga</i>,
ch. 8 f. (see above); and in Saxo Grammaticus, <i>Dan. Hist.</i>,
pp. 309 ff.</p>

<p><i>The Sons of Eric Björnson were Önund and Björn.</i> These
are probably to be identified with the Swedish kings Bern
and Anoundus mentioned in Rembertus' <i>Life of St. Ansgar</i>,
chs. 11 and 19, in connection with the saint's missionary visits
to Sweden (<i>c.</i> 830).</p>

<p><i>Bragi Skald</i> was the great grandfather of Arinbjörn the
friend of Egil Skallagrímsson. In the <i>Saga of Egil Skallagrímsson</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page244" id="page244"></a>[pg 244]</span>
ch. 59, he is said to have saved his life by composing
in one night a poem in honour of King Björn. Some fragments
of his poems have been preserved&mdash;the earliest datable
Norse poems which have come down to us.</p>

<p><i>King Harold the Fairhaired.</i> See the <i>Tháttr of Nornagest</i>,
ch. 10, and note.</p>

<p><i>Eric the Victorious.</i> The battle won by Eric the Victorious
over Styrbjörn at Fyrisvellir seems to have taken place
between 980 and 985. Several Runic inscriptions contain
references to it. The statement that Harold the Fairhaired
died in Eric's time can hardly be correct; for Harold is
believed to have died in 933.</p>

<p><i>Fyrisvellir</i>, on the banks of the Fyriså, close to the site of
the modern town of Upsala.</p>

<p><i>Olaf the Swede.</i> The traditional date of his conversion is
1008.</p>

<p><i>Olaf the Saint</i>, ex-King of Norway, whence he had been
expelled in 1028, was killed at the Battle of Stiklestad in 1030
in an attempt to recover the throne.</p>

<p><i>He tried to put an end to</i>, etc. An interesting account of
the heathen ceremonies of the Swedes, dating from shortly
after the middle of the eleventh century, is given by Adam
of Bremen in his <i>History of the Church of Hamburg</i>, Book <span class="sc">iv</span>.,

that mentioned in schol. 134 to Adam of Bremen as

<p class="indent">31.<a href="#fbn31"><sub>°</sub></a> <i>The saddle-buckle</i>, etc. In Lyngbye's version of the

the following stanza is found:</p>

<p>[Grani] sprang across the pool</p>
<p class="i2">And his saddle-buckle brake.</p>
<p>And as I ween that saddle-buckle</p>

<p>In the <i>Ballad of Regin the Smith</i> we are told that the
accident to Grani occurred when Sigurth was on his way
home from Gnítaheið after slaying Fafnir. Grani was
heavily laden with treasure and Sigurth also was mounted on
him, so that the accident there appears perfectly natural.</p>

<p>But he adds a version corresponding to Hammershaimb's in
a footnote and states that it is frequently sung so.</p>

<a name="nfbn42" id="nfbn42"></a>
<p class="indent">42.<a href="#fbn42"><sub>°</sub></a> <i>The courteous man.</i> According to Lyngbye, by a

the origin of the word (<i>kurtis</i>) is unknown. It is of course the
same as the Icelandic <i>kurteis</i> which is a French loan-word.</p>

<p>According to Lyngbye it was still part of popular Faroese
legend in his day that Nornagest kept his candle in a little
leaden casket which was sunk in a lake. Lyngbye says that
Nornagest was regarded as the 'Nestor' of the Faroes,
which is quite in accordance both with his "three hundred
years" mentioned in the saga, and with the unusually long
span of life often associated with the External Soul of folklore.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 3em;">THE BALLAD OF HJALMAR AND ANGANTYR<a href="#bha"><sub>°</sub></a></h4>

<p class="indent">1. <i>In a high oak-tree.</i> In the version of this ballad obtained
by Hammershaimb at Sumbø the first line runs 'A man
there lived on (lit. 'in') an island high,' whereas in the <i>Ballad
of Arngrim's Sons</i>, v. 3, we are told that Arngrim and his
sons lived 'under' an oak. Possibly the first line of our text
is a confusion of these two versions. The error is made more
comprehensible by the fact that there are no trees on the
Faroes, and so the phrase must have been a meaningless jingle
of words to the singers.</p>

<p><i>Arngrim's sons from Africa.</i> The text has 'Arngrim's sons
from Bláland,' by which the Faroese ballads and the <i>Fornaldar
Sögur</i> generally mean Africa. Here, however, we
should more naturally have expected 'Norway,' and it is
very probable that, as Hammershaimb suggests, we here have
the refrain in a corrupt form as so often happens. Probably
'from Bláland' (<i>af Blálandum</i>) should be 'from Bólmland'
(af <i>Bólmlandi</i>), i.e. from the Island of Bólm, but the Faroese
may have substituted the more familiar name for that of the
island with which they were unacquainted.</p>

<a name="nbha2" id="nbha2"></a>
<p class="indent">2.<a href="#bha2"><sub>°</sub></a> <i>The champions Hjalmar</i>, etc. The Sumbø version has:</p>

<p>The twelfth is the warrior Angantyr,</p>
  </div>  </div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page248" id="page248"></a>[pg 248]</span>
<p>and also inserts immediately following a verse giving reasons
for the voyage:</p>

was the first to step,' etc.; but the following v. has
'Hjalmar was the first to step!' The Sumbø version, which
is undoubtedly better here, has</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p><i>Angantyr loypur so tungliga á land</i></p>
<p>Angantyr leapt so heavily to land,</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>instead of</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p><i>Fyrstur steig Angantýr fótum á land</i></p>
<p>Angantyr was the first to step with his feet to land.</p>
  </div>  </div>

  <a name="nbha10" id="nbha10"></a>
<p class="indent">10.<a href="#bha10"><sub>°</sub></a> <i>Here sittest thou</i>, etc. In the Sumbø version, Hjalmar's
request is not recorded. The repetition of Angantyr's request
in our text, if it has any significance at all, implies that both
Hjalmar and Angantyr made the proposal.</p>

<a name="nbha18" id="nbha18"></a>
<p class="indent">18.<a href="#bha18"><sub>°</sub></a> <i>O franklin, lend me</i>, etc. The Sumbø version here

<p class="indent">19.<a href="#bha19"><sub>°</sub></a> <i>Forth of the hall.</i> In the Sumbø version the fight took
place outside the hall, and only Angantyr is credited with the
troll-like bellowing. Indeed one feels throughout the Sumbø
version a more clearly defined hostility to Angantyr on the
part of the balladist, whereas the Westmanhavn version is
more detached in its attitude.</p>

"<i>Alff ... Odderskier</i>." <span class="sc">ms</span>. C. has "<i>Ulff ... Oderskier</i>."
<span class="sc">ms</span>. D

be 'a combination of Arngrim the father of the berserks and
Hjalmar's foster-brother Örvarodd.'</p>

<a name="ndbah7" id="ndbah7"></a>
<p class="indent">7.<a href="#dbah7"><sub>°</sub></a> <i>Gold shone on his hand.</i> The phrase is not quite clear. It
may possibly refer to some personal ornament, but in view
of the following line, would seem more probably to indicate
that Angelfyr offered money to the King of Upsala.</p>
<a name="ndbah11" id="ndbah11"></a>
<p class="indent">11.<a href="#dbah11"><sub>°</sub></a> <i>He is half a troll</i>, So A, which is in accordance with
Angelfyr's ancestry as told in the <i>Saga of Hervör and Heithrek</i>,
ch. <span class="sc">i</span>. B and D, however, like the Faroese, have 'He is so
vile a troll.' A gives little sense, considering the second half
of the verse, and the whole becomes a meaningless formula in
all the versions in which Angantyr and Hjalmar are described
as brothers.</p>
<a name="ndbah18" id="ndbah18"></a>
<p class="indent">18.<a href="#dbah18"><sub>°</sub></a> <i>Whom he himself will have.</i> Possibly <i>han</i>, 'he,' is a
misprint for <i>hón</i>, 'she,' which is what we should expect.
Cf. the <i>Saga of Hervör and Heithrek</i>, ch. 3. One hardly
expects a cynical touch like this in an authentic ballad. But
the whole of the latter part of B may be a later version than
the original.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 3em;">THE FAROESE BALLAD OF ARNGRIM'S SONS<a href="#fbas"><sub>°</sub></a></h4>

<p class="indent"><i>Refrain.</i> I have adopted the refrain given in Hammershaimb's
version of the Ballad, taken down on Sandø in 1848
and published in the <i>Antiq. Tídss.</i>, 1849-1851, rather than
Svabo's version which he afterwards adopted, but which is
very obscure and possibly corrupt.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page250" id="page250"></a>[pg 250]</span>

<a name="nfbas2" id="nfbas2"></a>
<p class="indent">2.<a href="#fbas2"><sub>°</sub></a> <i>Bjarnaland</i>, so sing the Faroese according to both Svabo
and Hammershaimb. By <i>Bjarnaland</i> they mean Norway.
Contrast, however, the <i>Saga of Hervör and Heithrek</i>, ch. 2,
where we are distinctly told that Angantyr's mother was
Eyfura who had been carried off by Arngrim from <i>Bjarmaland</i>
(i.e. the land of the Perms) where her father was king. See
also the note on this passage. The Faroese have no doubt
confused the unfamiliar name with one more familiar to
themselves.</p>

<a name="nfbas3" id="nfbas3"></a>
<p class="indent">3.<a href="#fbas3"><sub>°</sub></a> <i>Beneath oak trees live they</i>&mdash;a common ballad formula
with no real significance. It is interesting, however, as a touch
indicating the literary origin of this and other stories told in
the Faroese ballads. As has been remarked (see p. 247 above)
there are no trees on the Faroes. On the other hand farm
houses in Scandinavian lands stand frequently beneath the
shadow of a large oak. For a discussion of this subject, see
Chadwick, <i>Cult of Othin</i> (Cambridge, 1899), p. 72 ff.
Compare the Scottish Ballad of <i>Rose the Red and White Lily</i>,
v. 38:</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Then out and spak' the King again,</p>
<p class="i2">Says, "Bonny boy, tell to me</p>

<a name="nfbas4" id="nfbas4"></a>
<p class="indent">4.<a href="#fbas4"><sub>°</sub></a> <i>Arngrim and the Earl's lady</i>, etc. So Svabo. In Hammershaimb's

the daughter of Angantyr.</p>

<a name="nfbas7" id="nfbas7"></a>
<p class="indent">7.<a href="#fbas7"><sub>°</sub></a> <i>Better than fighting</i>, etc. The incident of a <i>boy</i> playing
too roughly with his companions and being told by them to go
and avenge his father instead of maltreating them is very
widespread. Prof. Ker notes its occurrence (<i>On the History
of the Ballads</i> 1100-1500, p. 194) in the Irish Romance of
Maelduin, in four Norwegian, five Faroese, two or three
Danish ballads, in a Literary History of the Arabs and in
New Guinea.</p>

<a name="nfbas8" id="nfbas8"></a>
<p class="indent">8.<a href="#fbas8"><sub>°</sub></a> <i>Water she cast</i>, etc. The passage is obscure. It is not
clear if Hervik had actually been fighting with the 'lads,' so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page251" id="page251"></a>[pg 251]</span>
that the cleansing of her armour was an actual necessity; or if
she had only been playing rather roughly. <i>Leika</i> can mean
both 'to play' and 'to fight'; and <i>leikvöllr</i> may mean both a
'playground' and a 'battlefield.' If Hervik had only been
playing, the throwing of the water on the armour was possibly
a rite performed before undertaking vengeance.</p>

<a name="nfbas9" id="nfbas9"></a>
<p class="indent">9.<a href="#fbas9"><sub>°</sub></a> <i>Die on straw.</i> To 'die on straw' is the regular idiom in
Faroese and Icelandic for to 'die in one's bed,' of old age or
sickness, as opposed to death by the sword.</p>

<a name="nfbas10" id="nfbas10"></a>
<p class="indent">10.<a href="#fbas10"><sub>°</sub></a> <i>Isan's Grove.</i> Hammershaimb suggests that by <i>Isan's
Land</i> here and in vv. 20 and 21 below the Faroese mean
<i>Samsø</i>. On the other hand there was a forest in Holstein in
ancient times called <i>Isarnho</i>, and some such name may possibly
be preserved here. There was a King <i>Isung</i> mentioned in the
Danish Ballad <i>De vare syv og syvsindstyve</i>, as an opponent of
King <i>Didrik</i>; but it is improbable that his land is here indicated.</p>

<p class="indent">14.<a href="#fbas14"><sub>°</sub></a> <i>Up then rose Hervik</i>, etc. vv. 14, 15, 16 and 20 are
identical with vv. 12-16 (inclusive) of <i>Olufu Kvæði</i>, the
only change being that 'Hugin the King' takes the place of
'Hervik the Earl's daughter.' They are practically identical
too with the <i>Kvæði of the Jómsvíkingar</i>, vv. 6-8 (inclusive).
Cf. also <i>Sjurðar Kvæði</i> (<span class="sc">iii</span> <i>Högna Táttur</i>, vv. 46-49),
and <i>Ragnarlikkja</i>, vv. 40-48.</p>

<a name="nfbas20" id="nfbas20"></a>
<p class="indent">20.<a href="#fbas20"><sub>°</sub></a> <i>Striped gold on a scarlet ground.</i> The text has <i>Gull við
reyðan brand</i>, which is probably a mishearing of the line
<i>Gull við reyðan rand</i> ('with a gold stripe on a red ground').
Verse 39 of <i>Brúsajökils Kvæði</i> (which is otherwise identical
with the above) gives in the second line <i>Gull við ráum brann</i>
('gold blazed on the yardarms'). In Hammershaimb's version
of our ballad, vv. 10, 72, the line is <i>Gulli vovin við rand</i>
('woven with gold in stripes'), as also in v. 22 of the <i>Kvæði
of Ormar Torolvsson</i>. The line also occurs in the form <i>Gull
við vágum rann</i> ('the margin of the ship was gold down to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page252" id="page252"></a>[pg 252]</span>
where it touched the waves'). This is no doubt corrupt, but
it is difficult to conjecture as to which of all the variants was
the original form of the line.</p>

<p class="indent">60.<a href="#fbas60"><sub>°</sub></a> <i>Her cheeks they are as red and white</i>, etc. Cf. the <i>Kvæði
of Finnur hin Fríði</i>, v. 18. Cf. also the old Celtic romance of
the <i>Fate of the Sons of Usna</i>: "I should like," said Deirdre,

"that he who is to be my husband should have these three
colours: his hair as black as the raven: his cheeks red as the
blood: his skin like the snow" (Joyce's translation). Cf. also
Grimm's story of <i>Little Snowdrop</i>.</p>

in almost identical form in <i>Olufu Kvæði</i>, vv. 22-35.</p>

<a name="nfbas69" id="nfbas69"></a>
<p class="indent">69.<a href="#fbas69"><sub>°</sub></a> <i>Angantyr was the first to light</i>, etc. A common ballad
formula, both Faroese and Danish.</p>

<a name="nfbas88" id="nfbas88"></a>
<p class="indent">88.<a href="#fbas88"><sub>°</sub></a> <i>I would not that lady Ingibjörg hear</i>, etc. Lit. "the lady
Ingibjörg will learn that I fled." There is a suppressed condition.
"If I let you fight, the lady Ingibjörg would learn, etc."
Hammershaimb's text (<i>Antiq. Tídss.</i>) v. 37, has a negative and
no condition: "The lady Ingibjörg shall not learn," etc.</p>

<a name="nfgr9" id="nfgr9"></a>
<p class="indent">9.<a href="#fgr9"><sub>°</sub></a> <i>Thunder is the red drum.</i> Probably <i>reyða</i> ('red') is a
printer's error for <i>reiða</i> ('angry'), though the same form
occurs also in the version of the ballad published in the <i>Antiquarisk
Tídsskrift</i>. In v. 16, however, we find <i>skarið</i> whereas
in v. 17 the word is written <i>skarðið</i>, the form used in both
verses in <i>Antiq. Tídss.</i>, and the two words are obviously
identical in both verses. Moreover in v. 21 <i>einir</i> ('own,'
'single') which gives little sense, is surely an error for
<i>eingir</i> ('no,' adj.) as in vv. 11, 17, 19. The negative is also
found in v. 21 in the version in the <i>Antiq. Tídss.</i>, in the form
<i>ei</i>,
'they have <i>not</i> fathers or mothers.' Indeed the entire ballad
would seem to be somewhat carelessly printed in <i>Færöiske
Kvæðer</i>.</p>
